T1  - Value of distinguishing differentiated thyroid carcinoma by miRNA
AB  - Current methods for diagnosing thyroid carcinoma are time consuming or expensive. Thus, alternative approaches are required. In the present study, microRNAs (miRNAs) with higher sensitivity and specificity were screened while distinguishing between differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and subtype papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). A total of 120 cases suspected of having thyroid carcinoma were selected and examined using clinical color Doppler ultrasound, and computed tomography scan at the same time. The tissue specimens were obtained with fine needle aspiration, multiphase biopsy and surgical resection. The expression of miR146b, miR221 and miR222 was detected uisng the RT-quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to obtain the cut-off value. Pathological examination identified 8 cases of normal thyroid tissue; 9 cases of hyperplastic nodules; 12 cases of thyroid adenoma; and 91 cases of thyroid carcinoma, of which 59 cases were DTC, 15 cases were follicular carcinoma and 17 cases were undifferentiated carcinoma. In the thyroid carcinoma, the expression levels of miR146b, miR221 and miR222 were significantly higher than those of other tissues (P<0.05). The expression levels of these miRNAs in the differentiated type were also significantly higher than those in the undifferentiated type (P<0.05). A comparison of the differentiated subunit identified no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). Following diagnosis of DTC, the area under curve (AUC) of miR146b, miR221 and miR222 was 0.832, 0.806 and 0.745, respectively; the cut-off values were 1.346, 1.213 and 1.425, respectively; susceptibility was 72.8, 71.5 and 68.7%, respectively; and specificity was 62.3, 60.9 and 59.3%, respectively. The AUC of the combined miR-146b and -221 following diagnosis of PTC was 0.695; the cut-off values were 1.506 and 1.462, respectively; susceptibility was 78.9%; and specificity was 68.5%. The AUC of the combined miR-146b and -222 was 0.677; the cut-off values were 1.523 and 1.443, respectively; susceptibility was 76.3%; and specificity was 66.4%. The AUC of the combined miR-221 and -222 was 0.662; the cut-off values were 1.564 and 1.437, respectively; susceptibility was 74.9%; and specificity was 68.2%. In conclusion, miR146b, miR221 and miR222 may be used as susceptibility and specificity indices of DTC, although they cannot be used as susceptibility or specificity indices for distinguishing PTC. Combining the two indices together can improve diagnostic accuracy to a certain extent.

T1  - Role of the Mechanisms of Detection in the Increased Risk of Thyroid Cancer: A Retrospective Cohort Study in an HMO in Buenos Aires
AB  - Background: Two hypotheses attempt to explain the increase of thyroid cancer (TC) incidence: overdetection by excessive diagnostic scrutiny and a true increase in new cases brought about by environmental factors. Changes in the mechanism of detection and the risk of incidentally diagnosed TC could result in an increase of TC incidence.Methods: Retrospective cohort study. We identified incident cases of TC from the pathological reports of patients in a HMO and review of clinical records. The results were analyzed in two periods: 2003-2007 and 2008-2012. Incidence rates expressed per 100,000 person-years (with 95% CI) and relative risk of incidence rates of incidental and nonincidental TC were estimated.Results: The relative risk of incidentally detecting a thyroid cancer in 2008-2012 compared to 2003-2007 was 6.06 (95%CI 1.84-20.04). Clinical evaluations detected 31 (75.6%) cancers in the period 2003-2007 and 70 (51.8%) cancers in the period 2008-2012 (p<0.007). Although tumor median size was significantly lower in the period 2008-2012 (10 vs. 14 mm, p<0.03), tumors greater than 40 mm (4.3%) were only present in 2008-2012. The female/male ratio decreased between analyzed periods from 8 (3-21) to 4 (3-7).Conclusions: Our findings partially support the hypothesis of increased incidence due to overdetection but do not explain the changes in the increase of larger tumors and decrease in the female/male ratio, which could be secondary to the influence of unidentified environmental factors.

T1  - Comparison of incidental versus palpable thyroid nodules presenting for fine-needle aspiration biopsy
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many attribute the rise in incidence of thyroid cancer to a deluge of radiologically identified incidental thyroid nodules. The clinical implications are unclear.METHODS: A review was performed of all patients who underwent fine-needle aspirations of thyroid nodules by our academic medical center's Endocrinology Division between 2006 and 2010. Medical records were reviewed to identify whether the thyroid nodule was discovered incidentally or by palpation.RESULTS: Of 1153 patients, 37.4% underwent a biopsy because of an incidental thyroid nodule. These patients were significantly more likely to be >45 years old, men, white race, and with a body mass index >30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> . Of the 17.2% of incidentalomas that led to surgery, 8.5% were found to be thyroid cancer.CONCLUSION: Thyroid nodules discovered incidentally are increasing the diagnosis of subclinical thyroid cancers. Not investigated previously, our study found that the mode of detection was not related to malignancy or surgery.

T1  - Preoperative diagnostics in differentiated thyroid carcinoma
AB  - AIM: The preoperative diagnosis of differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC) is particularly challenging in view of the high prevalence of thyroid nodules in the general population. Incidental diagnosis of DTC, on the other hand, can lead to reoperations and increased risk of morbidity. This study aimed to assess the prediction value of preoperative DTC dignity assessment and it's impact on surgical approaches.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 107 cases of DTC and subdivided them in three groups based on the preoperative dignity assessment: suspected malignancy (SM), unclear dignity (UD), and incidental findings (IF). The group differences were investigated in terms of diagnostic methods, findings, and impact on the subsequent surgical approach.RESULTS: The patient groups consisted of n = 51 (SM), n = 32 (UD), and n = 24 (IF). The tumor size, T staging, and ultrasound (US) assessment had the largest impact on the dignity classification (each p < 0.001). Scintigraphy was performed in 80 % of the patients, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in 28 %. Hypofunction at scintigraphy (p < 0.001) and cytology results (p < 0.01) were identified as significant predictors for group assignment. Other significant factors were the frequency of the US documentation of nodule characteristics (p < 0.001) and malignancy criteria (p < 0.01) as well as reduced thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (p < 0.01). Frozen section (p < 0.001) and total thyroidectomy (p < 0.01) at initial surgery were performed significantly more often in the MV group. Reoperations were significantly more frequent in the IF group (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: A relevant number of DTC cases was diagnosed incidentally, leading to significantly more frequent reoperations. A more systematic diagnostic approach with complete documentation of the findings according to current guidelines should be pursued.

T1  - Clinical features of recently diagnosed papillary thyroid carcinoma in elderly patients aged 65 and older based on 10 years of sonographic experience at a single institution in Korea
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in patients aged 65 and older in order to predict postoperative recurrence based on the results of ultrasonographic surveillance.METHODS: Among 1,494 patients (200 male and 1,294 female; mean age, 46.6+/-11.3 years) who underwent surgery for thyroid cancer at our institution between 2006 and 2015, we retrospectively enrolled 150 PTC patients (29 male and 121 female; mean age, 69.4+/-4.2 years). To identify the risk factors for recurrence, we analyzed age, gender, multiplicity, size, number, extrathyroidal extension (ETE) of the tumor, lymph node metastasis (LNM), type of surgery, and the dose of radioactive ablation using a Cox regression model to identify hazard ratios (HRs).RESULTS: Among the 115 asymptomatic patients with PTCs detected by screening ultrasonography (n=86), other cross-sectional imaging modalities (computed tomography or positron emission tomography-computed tomography, n=13), or incidentally through a surgical specimen (n=16), 78 patients were confirmed to have papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs). The other 35 patients presented with palpable neck masses (n=25), vocal cord palsy (n=9) or blood-tinged sputum (n=1). During the follow-up period (mean, 43.6 months), 17 patients (12.5%) experienced recurrence in the neck. None of the patients died due to PTC-related recurrence or distant metastasis during the follow-up period. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that tumor size (HR, 2.12; P<0.001) and LNM (central LNM: HR, 9.08; P=0.004; lateral LNM: HR, 14.71; P=0.002; both central and lateral LNM: HR, 58.41; P<0.001) significantly increased the recurrence rate. ETE, LNM, and recurrence were significantly less frequent in PTMCs than in non-PTMC (all P<0.001).CONCLUSION: PTCs of small size and absent LNM showed significantly better prognoses in patients 65 years and older.

T1  - Long-term survival of patients with thyroid cancer according to the methods of tumor detection: A nationwide cohort study in Korea
AB  - In this retrospective cohort study, we compared the survival of patients detected by screening with those detected based on symptoms, according to their tumor stages. After propensity score matching, 2,130 patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer, identified by screening detection (SD) and clinical detection (CD), were included. We compared the survival rates of patients identified by SD and CD in the early and advanced stages of thyroid cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality between the two groups. Of the 1,065 patients in each group, 12 (1.1%) died in the SD group, compared to 44 (4.1%) in the CD group, during an average 9.4 years (p<0.001). For early stage, there was no significant difference in all-cause and thyroid cancer-specific mortality between the two groups (p = 0.08, p = 0.0502). However, for advanced stage, the survival rates in the SD group were significantly higher than in the CD group (p<0.001, p = 0.004). Moreover, after adjusting for covariates, the HRs of all-cause mortality of the SD group was significantly lower than that of the CD group for the advanced stage patients (HRs: 0.37 [95% CIs: 0.17-0.80]), while no significant difference was observed in the early stage. While screening for thyroid cancer was not beneficial for early stage patients, our findings suggest that detection via screening is associated with better survival for patients with advanced stage cancer. However, the effects of selection bias and lead time bias could not be entirely excluded.

T1  - Incidental versus non-incidental thyroid carcinoma: Clinical presentation, surgical management and prognosis
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Thyroid cancer may be clinically evident as a tumor mass in the neck or as a histopathological incidental finding after thyroid surgery for an apparent benign condition. Our objective was to assess the differences in clinical signs, surgical management, and course between incidental and clinically diagnosed thyroid tumors.METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients operated on for benign or malignant thyroid disease from January 2000 to March 2014. Among the 1415 patients who underwent any thyroid surgery, 264 neoplasms were found, of which 170 were incidental. A comparison was made of incidental versus non-incidental carcinomas. Among incidental carcinomas, cases whose indication for surgery was Graves' disease were compared to those with multinodular goiter.RESULTS: Incidental carcinomas were in earlier stages and required less aggressive surgery. There were no differences in surgical complications between incidental and clinical tumors, but mortality and relapses were markedly higher in non-incidental cancers (4.4% vs 0% and 13.2% vs 4.8% respectively). Carcinomas developing on Graves' disease showed no differences from all other incidental tumors in terms of complications, mortality, or relapse after surgery.CONCLUSIONS: Early stage thyroid cancer has better survival and prognosis after surgical treatment.

T1  - Prevalence of thyroid nodules in the Valley of Mexico
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no open population epidemiological studies to determine the true prevalence of thyroid nodules in the Valley of Mexico. The aim of this investigation was to determine prevalence.METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional, observational, descriptive study in 2401 open population subjects in the Valley of Mexico. All subjects were at least 18 years of age with no clinical history of thyroid disease. Variables analyzed were age, gender, thyroid nodule identified by neck palpation or neck ultrasound, TSH levels, cytological diagnosis and histopathological diagnosis in case of clinical thyroid nodule detection. Percentages as a summary measure for qualitative variables and proportions and chi-square for independent variables were used for statistical analysis.RESULTS: Included were 2401 subjects with a mean age of 39 years (82.4% female, 17.6% male). Thirty-four (1.4%) thyroid nodules were detected by palpation and 471 (19.6%) by ultrasound. The 34 palpable thyroid nodules corresponded to 16 (47.2%) colloid goiters, 8 (23.5%) follicular adenomas, 7 (20.5%) Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 2 (5.9%) papillary carcinomas and 1 (2.9%) oxiphilic cell adenoma. Nonpalpable thyroid nodules detected by ultrasound did not develop illness at 2-year follow-up. TSH was normal in 1620 (67.4%), high in 515 (21.5%) and low in 266 (11.1%) patients. There was no relationship between TSH levels and final diagnosis of the 34 palpable nodules (p >0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of palpable thyroid nodule in the Valley of Mexico is 1.4%; 5.9% of these are due to papillary thyroid cancer. TSH levels do not correlate with the presence or cause of the thyroid nodule.

T1  - Thyroid cancer is more likely to be detected incidentally on imaging in private hospital patients
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) is increasing. Patients with higher socioeconomic status have higher rates of WDTC, possibly due to increased imaging and overdiagnosis. We compared methods of WDTC diagnosis in patients treated at a public and an adjacent private university hospital.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with WDTC at the two hospitals between 2004 and 2010 were included. Patients were categorized into having their WDTC discovered on physical examination or on unrelated imaging. Demographic and pathologic data were collected. T-test was used for quantitative variables, and chi-squared test was used for categorical values. Binomial logistic regression was used to asses for confounding.RESULTS: Among 473 patients, 402 (85%) were from the university hospital, and 71 (15%) were from the public hospital. Patients from the university hospital were older (mean age: 49 versus 44, P = 0.02) and had a different racial composition compared to those from the public hospital. The patients at the public hospital had larger tumors (23 versus 18 mm, P = 0.04). Patients from the university hospital were more likely to have WDTC detected by imaging than patients in the public hospital (46% versus 28%, P < 0.01) on univariate analysis.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that patients with WDTC treated at a university hospital are more likely to have their tumor detected on unrelated imaging than those treated at a public hospital. These data may support the hypothesis that patients with improved insurance are more likely to have WDTC detected by imaging.

T1  - Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of thyroid cancer: A population-based temporal trend study
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increase in incidence of thyroid cancer during the last decades without concomitant rise in mortality may reflect the growing detection of indolent forms of thyroid cancer, and may have fueled unnecessary thyroidectomies. Our aim was therefore, to compare recent secular trends in surgical intervention rate for thyroid cancer with the incidence and mortality of thyroid cancer to assess overdiagnosis and resulting overtreatment.METHODS: We conducted a population-based temporal trend study in Switzerland from 1998 to 2012. All cases of invasive thyroid cancer, deaths from thyroid cancer, and cancer-related thyroidectomies were analyzed. We calculated changes in age-standardized thyroid cancer incidence rates, stratified by histologic subtype and tumor stage, thyroid cancer-specific mortality, and thyroidectomy rates.RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2012, the age-standardized annual incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 5.9 to 11.7 cases/100,000 among women (annual mean absolute increase: +0.43/100,000/year) and from 2.7 to 3.9 cases/100,000 among men (+0.11/100,000/year). The increase was limited to the papillary subtype, the most indolent form of thyroid cancer. The incidence of early stages increased sharply, the incidence of advanced stages increased marginally, and the mortality from thyroid cancer decreased slightly. There was a three- to four-fold increase in the age-standardized annual thyroidectomy rate in both sexes.CONCLUSIONS: We observed a large increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer, limited to papillary and early stage tumors, with a three- to four-fold parallel increase in thyroidectomy. The mortality slightly decreased. These findings suggest that a substantial and growing part of the detected thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed and overtreated.IMPACT: Targeted screening and diagnostic strategies are warranted to avoid overdetection and unnecessary treatment of thyroid cancers.

T1  - Screening for Thyroid Cancer: Updated Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force
AB  - Importance: The incidence of detected thyroid cancer cases has been increasing in the United States since 1975. The majority of thyroid cancers are differentiated cancers with excellent prognosis and long-term survival.Objective: To systematically review the benefits and harms associated with thyroid cancer screening and treatment of early thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.Data Sources: Searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies published from January 1966 through January 2016, with active surveillance through December 2016.Study Selection: English-language studies conducted in asymptomatic adult populations.Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently appraised the articles and extracted relevant study data from fair- or good-quality studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to pool surgical harms.Main Outcomes and Measures: Thyroid cancer morbidity and mortality, test accuracy to detect thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer, and harms resulting from screening (including overdiagnosis) or treatment of thyroid cancer.Results: Of 10424 abstracts, 707 full-text articles were reviewed, and 67 studies were included for this review. No fair- to good-quality studies directly examined the benefit of thyroid cancer screening. In 2 studies (n=354), neck palpation was not sensitive to detect thyroid nodules. In 2 methodologically limited studies (n=243), a combination of selected high-risk sonographic features was specific for thyroid malignancy. Three studies (n=5894) directly addressed the harms of thyroid cancer screening, none of which suggested any serious harms from screening or ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. No screening studies directly examined the risk of overdiagnosis. Two observational studies (n=39211) included cohorts of persons treated for well-differentiated thyroid cancer and persons with no surgery or surveillance; however, these studies did not adjust for confounders and therefore were not designed to determine if earlier or immediate treatment vs delayed or no surgical treatment improves patient outcomes. Based on 36 studies (n=43295), the 95% CI for the rate of surgical harm was 2.12 to 5.93 cases of permanent hypoparathyroidism per 100 thyroidectomies and 0.99 to 2.13 cases of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy per 100 operations. Based on 16 studies (n=291796), treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer with radioactive iodine is associated with a small increase in risk of second primary malignancies and with increased risk of permanent adverse effects on the salivary gland, such as dry mouth.Conclusions and Relevance: Although ultrasonography of the neck using high-risk sonographic characteristics plus follow-up cytology from fine-needle aspiration can identify thyroid cancers, it is unclear if population-based or targeted screening can decrease mortality rates or improve important patient health outcomes. Screening that results in the identification of indolent thyroid cancers, and treatment of these overdiagnosed cancers, may increase the risk of patient harms.

T1  - Lower Rates of Residual/Recurrent Disease in Patients with Incidentally Discovered Thyroid Carcinoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Incidentally discovered thyroid cancers (IDTCs) have contributed to the rapid rise in thyroid cancer incidence over the past 20 years. Since death rates from thyroid cancer are not increasing, we hypothesized that IDTCs are less aggressive compared to clinically apparent thyroid cancer (CATC).METHODS: A retrospective study of patients and tumor characteristics of IDTCs and their rates of residual/recurrent (R/R) disease were determined at a median follow-up of 27 months in the setting of a large academic medical center. Patient analysis groups (IDTC [n = 46] and CATC [n = 126]) were based upon how the cancer was initially discovered. Patients were followed clinically and by biochemical testing and ultrasonography. We also compared time to progression between these groups.RESULTS: Patients in the two groups had similar demographic and tumor characteristics. At the close of the study, R/R status in the IDTC group was 6.7%, compared to 20.8% in the CATC group (P = .04). Of the 28 individuals in our overall cohort who had R/R disease, 3 were from the IDTC group and 25 were from the CATC group (P = .04). All three of the IDTC recurrences occurred within the first 6 months of follow-up. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend for longer progression-free survival in the IDTC group (P = .08).CONCLUSION: Compared to CATC patients, IDTC patients have a significantly less aggressive course and a trend toward longer progression-free survival. If confirmed by further studies, it may be reasonable to subject them to less intense surveillance and more conservative therapeutic approaches.ABBREVIATIONS: CATC = clinically apparent thyroid cancers CT = computed tomography HMH = Houston Methodist Hospital IDTC = incidentally discovered thyroid cancer MRI = magnetic resonance imaging PET = positron emission tomography PTMC = papillary thyroid microcarcinoma R/R = residual/recurrent RRA = radioiodine remnant ablation Tg = thyroglobulin TgAb = anti-thyroglobulin antibody TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone US = ultrasonography.

T1  - Association between screening and the thyroid cancer "epidemic" in South Korea: evidence from a nationwide study
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether screening for thyroid cancer led to the current "epidemic" in South Korea.DESIGN: Review of the medical records of nationally representative samples of patients with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer in 1999, 2005, and 2008.SETTING: Sample cases were randomly selected from South Korea's nationwide cancer registry, using a systematic sampling method after stratification by region.PARTICIPANTS: 5796 patients with thyroid cancer were included (891 in 1999, 2355 in 2005, and 2550 in 2008).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was age standardised incidence of thyroid cancer and the changes in incidence between 1999 and 2008 according to the methods used to detect tumours (screen detection versus clinical detection versus unspecified).RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2008, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased 6.4-fold (95% confidence interval 4.9-fold to 8.4-fold), from 6.4 (95% confidence interval 6.2 to 6.6) per 100000 population to 40.7 (40.2 to 41.2) per 100000 population. Of the increase, 94.4% (34.4 per 100000 population) were for tumours less than 20 mm, which were detected mainly by screening. 97.1% of the total increase was localised and regional tumours according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) summary stage. Where cases were clinically detected, 99.9% of the increased incidences (6.4 per 100000 population) over the same period were tumours less than 20 mm.CONCLUSION: The current "epidemic" of thyroid cancer in South Korea is due to an increase in the detection of small tumours, most likely as a result of overdetection. Concerted efforts are needed at a national level to reduce unnecessary thyroid ultrasound examinations in the asymptomatic general population.

T1  - 'Incidental' and 'non-incidental' thyroid papillary microcarcinomas are two different entities
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (microPTC) may be 'incidental' (Inc-microPTC), occasionally found at histology after surgery for benign disease or 'non-incidental' (Non-Inc-microPTC), diagnosed on clinical grounds. It is unclear whether these different microPTC reflect the same disease. The aim of the study was to compare Inc-microPTC and Non-Inc-microPTC for clinical and histological features as well as for serum TSH, a known factor involved in PTC development.DESIGN: We evaluated histology and serum TSH levels of consecutive patients submitted to thyroidectomy for goiter with compressive symptoms or for cytological diagnosis suspicious/indicative of PTC.METHODS: In total, 665 consecutive patients (259 with a single thyroid nodule, SN and 406 with a multinodular gland, MN) were included in the study. According to histology, patients were classified as: benign nodular goiter (Benign, n=291); Inc-microPTC (n=92); Non-Inc-microPTC (n=67) and PTC>=1cm (macroPTC, n=215).RESULTS: Inc-microPTC were significantly more frequent in MN than in SN (66/406, 16.2% vs 26/259, 10.0%, P=0.02). Patients with Inc-microPTC compared with Non-Inc-microPTC were older (mean age+/-s.d. 53.3+/-13.2 years vs 44.9+/-14.8 years, P=0.0002), had a smaller tumor size (median 4mm vs 9mm, P<0.0001), a higher frequency of multifocality (70/92, 76.1% vs 35/67, 52.2% P=0.001) and lower levels of TSH (median 0.6mIU/L, IR: 0.4-1.0mIU/L vs value 1. mIU/L, IR: 0.6-1.4mIU/L vs P=0.0001).CONCLUSION: Incidental and non-incidental papillary thyroid microcarcinomas appear to be two different entities.

T1  - The Impact of Subclinical Disease and Mechanism of Detection on the Rise in Thyroid Cancer Incidence: A Population-Based Study in Olmsted County, Minnesota During 1935 Through 2012
AB  - BACKGROUND: An ongoing epidemic of thyroid carcinoma (TC) has affected Americans since 1975. Understanding the contribution of subclinical disease and the mechanism of such disease detection may help to alter the course of this epidemic.METHODS: We used Rochester Epidemiology Project resources to examine the incidence of TC cases, disease specific mortality, and method of diagnosis during 1935 through 2012. During 2000-2012, we also extracted the mechanism of detection of clinically occult tumors.RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence (AAI) for TC increased from 7.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.5-8.8] per 100,000 person-years (p-y) during 1990-1999 to 13.7 [CI 11.8-15.6] per 100,000p-y during 2000-2012, with no change in disease-specific mortality since 1935. The incidence trend analysis stratified by the mechanism of detection revealed the AAI of clinically recognized TC was 5.5 per 100,000p-y [CI 3.4-7.5] in 1960-1969, a rate similar to the incidence seen during 2000-2012. However, AAI of clinically occult TC increased from 0.2 per 100,000p-y [CI 0.0-0.6] in 1935-1949 to 1.9 per 100,000p-y [CI 1.2-2.9] in 1990-1999 and to 7.4 per 100,000p-y [CI 6.0-8.8] in 2000-2012. During 2000-2012, the most frequent reasons for recognition of "occult" tumors were (1) incidental discovery during diagnostic neck imaging in 40 (19%), (2) pathology review of specimens from thyroid surgery for benign conditions in 29 (14%), and (3) investigations of patients with symptoms or palpable nodules that were clearly not associated with coexistent but occult TC but triggered the use of diagnostic neck imaging in 37 (27%).CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota, the rapid increased incidence of TC during 2000-2012 can be completely attributed to the increased diagnosis of occult TCs, which are mainly found through the use of diagnostic neck imaging. The incidence of clinical TC and disease-specific TC mortality remains stable since 1970, implying that the observed increased incidence is due to the increased detection of subclinical lesions.

T1  - Papillary thyroid carcinoma: prognostic significance of cancer presentation
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the clinical presentation of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has prognostic significance.METHODS: Retrospective evaluation was carried out of sequential, primary presentation, >1 cm diameter, PTC cases treated at a single center. PTC cases were grouped into 3 groups: (1) incidental detection by imaging, (2) incidental detection by physical examination, and (3) detection because of complaints related to a thyroid mass. The MACIS (metastasis, age, completeness of resection, invasion, and size) system was used to determine cancer prognosis for each group.RESULTS: Of the 168 PTC cases, 28 patients (17%) were in group 1, 60 patients (36%) were in group 2, and 80 patients (47%) were in group 3. Overall, 53% of differentiated thyroid cancers were detected incidentally. The difference in the proportion of patients in each MACIS score groups among the 3 clinical presentation categories, and for each component of the MACIS score, was not statistically significant (P = .36).CONCLUSION: The manner in which PTC initially clinically presents has no relationship with cancer prognosis.

T1  - Retrospective evaluation of the incidental finding of 403 papillary thyroid microcarcinomas in 2466 patients undergoing thyroid surgery for presumed benign thyroid disease
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to investigate the incidence of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) in patients operated for benign thyroid diseases (BTD) and its relation to age, sex, extent of surgery and type of BTD.METHODS: Retrospective study of 2466 patients who underwent thyroid surgery for BTD from 2008 to 2013. To determine independent predictors for PTMC we used three separate multivariate logistic regression models (MLR).RESULTS: There were 2128 (86.3%) females and 338 (13.7%) males. PTMC was diagnosed in 345 (16.2%) females and 58 (17.2%) males. Age ranged from 14 to 85 years (mean 54 years). Sex and age were not related to the incidence of PTMC. The overall incidence of PTMC was 16.3%. The highest incidence was in Hashimoto thyroiditis (22.7%, chi(2)=10.80, p<0.001); and in patients with total/near-total thyroidectomy (17.7%, chi(2)=7.05, p<0.008). The lowest incidence (6.6%, chi(2)=9.96, p<0.001) was in a solitary hyperfunctional thyroid nodule (SHTN). According to MLR, Hashimoto thyroiditis (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.15-2.05, p<0.003) and SHTN (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.87, p<0.019) are independent predictors. Since the extent of surgery was an independent predictor (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10-1.92, p=0.009) for all BTD, and sex and age were not; when the MLR model was adjusted for them, Graves disease (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.99, p<0.041) also proved to be an independent predictor.CONCLUSIONS: Sex and age are not statistically related to the incidence of PTMC in BTD. The incidence of PTMC is higher in Hashimoto thyroiditis and patients with total/near-total thyroidectomy; and lower in patients with a SHTN and Graves disease.

T1  - Incidence of occult papillary carcinoma of thyroid in Indian population: case series and review of literature
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To report the incidence of occult papillary carcinoma of thyroid in a tertiary care center in India in post-laryngectomy specimen of carcinoma of hypopharynx.SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of incidentally detected papillary carcinoma of thyroid in 358 patients of carcinoma of hypopharynx treated with total/near total laryngectomy at our tertiary care institute from 2005 to 2011.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Statistical analysis was performed using the software Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 20.0 (IBM, NY, USA). Percentages were calculated.RESULTS: Thyroid cancer was seen in 7/358 patients with incidence of 2%. Five patients had tumor localized to thyroid gland only. One patient had nodal metastasis with thyroid cancer and one had only metastatic cervical node with normal thyroid gland on final histopathology. Three of these patients (3/7) had a recurrence of carcinoma of hypopharynx within 1 year duration.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of occult papillary carcinoma of thyroid varies from 0.25% to 7% in the Indian literature.

T1  - Incidental papillary thyroid carcinoma: diagnostic findings in a series of 287 carcinomas
AB  - The recent increase in the detection of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has been influenced by the finding of incidental tumours. To this group, carcinomas measuring less than 1 cm (the so-called microcarcinomas) as well as those above 1 cm belong. Analyzing a case series from our own experience, this paper focuses on the current pre-operative diagnostic challenges that can lead to PTC incidental discovery. For this retrospective study, 287 patients with a PTC diagnosis were selected. For each, the following variables were analysed: sex, age, ultrasound (US) appearance, number of thyroid nodules, PTC size, PTC variants and presence of other associated pathology. Pre-operative fine needle aspiration (FNA) results were classified according to the five-tiered SIAPEC system. For 281 patients, the US-guided FNA results were available. Cytohistological correlation was evaluated in terms of FNA sensitivity and false negative rate. An incidental PTC was found in 45.2 % of patients. The majority of these were due to unsuccessful US detection of malignant nodules (103 cases); incorrect cytological diagnosis was responsible for the other 24 cases. The most powerful clinical confounding factors were: multinodular background versus single nodule presentations (p<0.001) and histotype (follicular vs conventional variant, p<0.05). Of course, tumour size remains a strongly influential feature on pre-operative diagnosis, with greater difficulties arising for carcinomas <5 mm. Moreover, FNA sensitivity was lower also in large PTCs (>2 cm) due to tumour heterogeneity. Although with limitations related to the tumour's intrinsic features and the thyroid background, US-guided FNA, especially if performed by a dedicated multidisciplinary team, is a powerful diagnostic tool for detecting malignant thyroid nodules. To the state of the art, we propose a practical clinical-pathological cut-off for this procedure, setting it at 5 mm.

T1  - Incidental carcinoma of the thyroid
AB  - The diagnosis of incidental thyroid carcinoma in patients submitted to thyroidectomy for a benign disease is quite frequent. A retrospective analysis was performed on 455 patients submitted to surgical intervention in order to establish the incidence of this kind of carcinoma. Two hundred fifty-six patients (56%) were affected by benign disease (176 multinodular goiter, 12 uninodular goiter, 1 Plummer disease and 67 Basedow disease) and 202 (44%) by carcinoma. In 28 of 256 patients (11%), affected by benign disease, occurred a histological diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma, (10 papillary carcinoma, 1 follicular carcinoma, 29 papillary carcinoma follicular variant). In this study it's considered incidental thyroid carcinoma the one occurred in patients who never underwent Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) and there were no suspicious features in all exams that may suggest the presence of carcinoma. Twenty-three of the 40 incidental carcinoma (57.5%) were microcarcinomas. Ten patients had a sincronous carcinoma. Actually, these patients are still in a follow up program and no recurrency of disease is occasionally observed. This study shows that the only way to put doubts on the real benignity of the disease is the fine needle aspiration; there are no other instruments that could identify the occurrence of the carcinoma. Moreover in the majority of cases the incidental carcinoma is a microcarcinoma, it doesn't reach significant volume, may be not centered by a FNA, but in most cases it's not really biologically aggressive.

T1  - Trends in incidentally identified thyroid cancers over a decade: a retrospective analysis of 2,090 surgical patients
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe trends in the incidence of incidental thyroid cancers and compare their characteristics with clinically presenting cancers.METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with thyroid cancer who underwent thyroid surgery from 2003 to 2012. Patients' initial presentation was categorized as incidental (on imaging or final surgical pathology) or clinical (palpable or symptomatic) cancer. Characteristics of incidental and clinical cancers were compared.RESULTS: Of the 2,090 patients who underwent thyroid surgery, 680 (33 %) were diagnosed with cancer. One hundred ninety (28 %) were incidental cancer, of which 101 were detected on imaging studies and 89 were detected on analysis of the surgical pathology specimens. The incidence of thyroid cancer increased by 7.6-fold from 2003 to 2012. The proportion of incidental cancers on imaging did not increase, but incidental cancers found on pathology steadily increased from 6 % in 2003 to 20 % in 2012. 84 % of the cancers were papillary cancer, and the proportion of papillary cancer was similar for both clinical and incidental cancers. Clinical cancers were larger than incidental cancers on imaging (2.2 vs. 1.8 cm, p = 0.02). Incidental cancers on imaging were less likely to have lateral compartment nodal metastases (7 vs. 13 %, p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid cancer diagnoses have increased at our institution, but the proportion of incidental cancers identified on imaging relative to clinical cancers has been stable over a decade and is not the sole explanation for the observed increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses. Incidental cancers on imaging are smaller in size and less likely to have lateral compartment nodal metastases than clinical cancers.

T1  - How are childhood thyroid nodules discovered: opportunities for improving early detection
AB  - In a retrospective analysis of childhood thyroid nodules, 18% were radiographic incidentalomas and 41% were discovered by a clinician's palpation; 40% were discovered by patients' families. The latter group had the largest nodules and highest rates of thyroid cancer metastasis, suggesting opportunities for earlier detection through annual well-child visits.

T1  - Thyroid surgical practices shaping thyroid cancer incidence in North-Eastern Italy
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of changing surgical practices on thyroid cancer incidence in the Veneto Region (North-Eastern Italy).METHODS: Hospital discharge records of the period 2000-2010 were analyzed to detect trends in thyroid surgery rates by type of surgery and diagnosis. The association between surgery rates for benign and malignant diseases across the 21 Local Health Units (LHUs) was assessed by Poisson regression. In a second step, clinical and pathological charts of the year 2010 were retrieved from the larger regional surgical center. The proportions of total and incidental papillary thyroid micro carcinoma (PTMC) were compared with historical data. Factors influencing an incidental diagnosis of PTMC were analyzed by logistic regression.RESULTS: Among 26,000 procedures performed in the Region, there was an increase with time in the proportion of total thyroidectomies (from 67% to 78%) and surgeries with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer (from 17% to 28%). Cancer surgery rates across LHUs resulted associated to surgery rates for benign diseases (P<0.001). In the largest regional center, the proportion of PTMC increased from 35% to 56%, of whom almost 60% were incidental cases. The probability of finding an incidental PTMC was higher in total thyroidectomies than in other procedures (odds ratio=1.84, 95% confidence interval 1.08-3.14).CONCLUSION: Data from the Veneto Region suggest that the increase in PTMC is due to several factors: increased preoperative diagnosis, total gland removal, extensive histological examination. Moreover, geographical variations in cancer incidence were associated to surgery rates for benign diseases.

T1  - Thyroid cancers detected by imaging are not necessarily small or early stage
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) in the United States is increasing rapidly. Much of this increase is due to the detection by imaging of small, nonpalpable tumors. The incidence of advanced WDTC is also increasing, suggesting a true increase in the incidence of WDTC. This study was performed to determine how WDTCs of all sizes and stages are initially detected.METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 519 patients who underwent surgery for WDTC from January 1, 2007, through August 31, 2010, was performed. A total of 473 patients suitable for inclusion in this study were divided into three groups based upon the method by which the tumor was initially detected: tumors detected by an imaging study (184 patients-39%), those detected because a mass was felt in the neck (218 patients-46%), and those detected incidentally on pathological study of the surgical specimen (71 patients-15%). Method of detection was correlated with age and sex of the patient, and size, stage, and nodal status of the tumor.RESULTS: Patients in the Palpation group were more likely to be female (79% vs. 67% vs. 74%), younger (46 vs. 51 vs. 52), and to have larger tumors than those in the Imaging or Incidental groups. In the Imaging group, the tumor was detected on thyroid sonogram in 98 (53%), computed tomography in 38 (21%), magnetic resonance imaging in 19 (10%), carotid duplex scan in 14 (8%), and positron-emission tomography or other imaging studies in 15 (8%). Thirty-three percent of tumors <1cm, 51% 1-2cm, 29% 2-4cm, and 38% >4cm were first detected on an imaging study. Forty-seven percent of Stage III and IV cancers in patients aged >=45 years and 39% of patients with positive central nodes were in the Imaging group.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that while most tumors discovered by imaging were small and early stage, almost half of advanced (Stage III and IV) WDTCs were initially discovered by imaging studies. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the frequent use of imaging studies may explain not only the increasing incidence of early WDTC, but more advanced thyroid cancers as well.

T1  - Clinical and pathological characteristics of incidental and nonincidental papillary thyroid microcarcinoma in 339 patients
AB  - BACKGROUND: We analyzed the incidence and the clinicopathological characteristics of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) in a high prevalence region of goiter with the purpose to investigate differences between incidental and nonincidental PTMC.METHODS: A total of 2236 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy from 2001 to 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. Papillary carcinoma was diagnosed in 583 patients. Of these, 339 patients with PTMC were included in the study. Clinicopathological features were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis.RESULTS: The prevalence of incidental PTMC was 12% of all patients who underwent surgery for thyroid disease. Univariate analysis showed that bilaterality (p = .001), autoimmune thyroid disease (p = .049), size of tumor >5 mm (p < .001), multifocality (p < .001), lymph node metastasis (p < .001), and capsule invasion (p < .001) were significantly associated with nonincidental PTMC. The incidence of lymph node metastasis in incidental PTMC was 5% versus 33% in nonincidental, suggesting that the biological behavior may be different in the 2 categories.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a high rate of PTMC presented 1 or more risk factors including multifocality, bilaterality, capsule invasion, and lymph node metastasis. Therefore, we suggest total thyroidectomy followed by adequate exploration of the central neck compartment for possible nodal involvement and resection as a safe therapeutic approach.

T1  - Evaluation of thyroid diseases and differentiated thyroid cancer in acromegalic patients
AB  - Thyroid diseases are frequently seen in patients with acromegaly. The aim of this study is to evaluate thyroid diseases and thyroid cancer in acromegalic patients followed in a single institution. The data of 92 acromegalic (43 male, 49 female) patients followed over 12 years were retrieved retrospectively from the hospital recordings. All available data for gender, age, body weight and height, duration of acromegaly, age at diagnosis of acromegaly, treatment methods for acromegaly and history of thyroid disease, serum GH, IGF-1, thyroid function tests, thyroid ultrasonography (US), thyroid scintigraphy and thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) results were recorded for the patients. The mean age of the patients was 43.9 +/- 10.8 years and the mean disease duration was 12 +/- 6.9 years. Thyroid US was performed in 64 patients who had nodular or diffuse goiter on palpation during the post-treatment follow-up and nodules were found in 44 (47.8 %) patients. Final diagnosis in 64 patients with thyroid US results and thyroid function tests including 26 patients with FNAB were as follows: 31 (48.4 %) benign multinodular goiter (MNG), 6 (9.4 %) simple nodular goiter, 1 (1.6 %) toxic MNG, 1 (1.6 %) Hurthle cell adenoma, and 5 (7.8 %) differentiated thyroid cancer. In addition, 9 (14.1 %) patients had diffuse goiter. One of the patients with diffuse goiter had amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis. Eleven (17.1 %) patients had normal thyroid US and no other thyroid disease. Patients with nodules had longer disease duration than patients without nodules (14.2 +/- 6.6 vs. 9.4 +/- 3.4 years, p = 0.043). Thyroid volume was positively correlated with post-treatment GH and post-treatment IGF-1 levels (r = 0.309, p = 0.041 and r = 0.423, p = 0.004), respectively. We found that 7.8 % of our acromegalic patients with thyroid US results were diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Therefore, acromegalic patients must be considered as a high risk group for the development of thyroid cancer and must be closely followed for thyroid nodules and tumors.

T1  - Characteristics of incidentally discovered thyroid cancer
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The incidence of thyroid cancer has been steadily increasing; however, no clear reason for the increase in incidence has been identified.OBJECTIVES: To compare incidentally discovered (ID) thyroid cancer via non-thyroid-related imaging with nonincidentally discovered (NID) thyroid cancer, as well as determine if differences in tumor characteristics and patient presentation in ID thyroid cancer may help elucidate the increasing incidence of this disease.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective medical record review at an academic tertiary care medical center of 31 patients with ID thyroid cancer and 207 patients with NID thyroid cancer evaluated at our institution during a 12-month period.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient demographics, tumor pathology, stage, tumor size, invasion, and metastasis were recorded.RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 56.4 years for the ID group and 41.8 years for the NID group (P < .001). The ID group was 54.8% male compared with 13.5% in the NID group (P < .001). The ID group had higher stage disease compared with the NID group (P = .003). There was no difference in tumor size (P = .91), invasion (P = .76), lymph node involvement, or distant metastases (P > .99).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with ID thyroid cancer tend to be older at presentation, have higher stage disease, and are more likely to be male compared with patients with NID thyroid cancer. There does not appear to be a significant difference in the size, pathology, or behavior of the tumor at presentation between ID and NID thyroid cancers. These findings imply that improved detection may not represent the only cause of the increased incidence of thyroid cancer.

T1  - The increasing incidence of thyroid cancer: the influence of access to care
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rapidly rising incidence of papillary thyroid cancer may be due to overdiagnosis of a reservoir of subclinical disease. To conclude that overdiagnosis is occurring, evidence for an association between access to health care and the incidence of cancer is necessary.METHODS: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data to examine U.S. papillary thyroid cancer incidence trends in Medicare-age and non-Medicare-age cohorts over three decades. We performed an ecologic analysis across 497 U.S. counties, examining the association of nine county-level socioeconomic markers of health care access and the incidence of papillary thyroid cancer.RESULTS: Papillary thyroid cancer incidence is rising most rapidly in Americans over age 65 years (annual percentage change, 8.8%), who have broad health insurance coverage through Medicare. Among those under 65, in whom health insurance coverage is not universal, the rate of increase has been slower (annual percentage change, 6.4%). Over three decades, the mortality rate from thyroid cancer has not changed. Across U.S. counties, incidence ranged widely, from 0 to 29.7 per 100,000. County papillary thyroid cancer incidence was significantly correlated with all nine sociodemographic markers of health care access: it was positively correlated with rates of college education, white-collar employment, and family income; and negatively correlated with the percentage of residents who were uninsured, in poverty, unemployed, of nonwhite ethnicity, non-English speaking, and lacking high school education.CONCLUSION: Markers for higher levels of health care access, both sociodemographic and age-based, are associated with higher papillary thyroid cancer incidence rates. More papillary thyroid cancers are diagnosed among populations with wider access to healthcare. Despite the threefold increase in incidence over three decades, the mortality rate remains unchanged. Together with the large subclinical reservoir of occult papillary thyroid cancers, these data provide supportive evidence for the widespread overdiagnosis of this entity.

T1  - Incidental cancer in patients surgically treated for benign thyroid disease. Our experience at a single institution
AB  - Increased incidence of incidental cancer in patients operated for benign thyroid disease has been reported. We report our experience about incidental thyroid cancer (ITC) in order to better characterize this nosologic entity. Between 2001 and 2009 a total of 568 patients underwent surgery for benign thyroid disease. Patients with preoperative cytology undetermined or positive for malignancy were excluded. The most frequent indication for surgery was multinodular or diffuse nontoxic goiter. We performed total thyroidectomy in 499 cases and emithyroidectomy in 69 cases. Final histology revealed ITC in 53 patients (9.3%): 44 had papillary carcinoma (20 classic variant and 24 follicular variant), 4 follicular carcinoma, 4 medullary carcinoma and 1 primitive thyroid paraganglioma. The preoperative diagnosis was multinodular or diffuse goiter in 45 cases of ITC and uninodular goiter in 8 cases. We performed total thyroidectomy in 46 case, emithyroidectomy in 4 patients with past history of lobectomy, emithyroidectomy in 3 patients with following radicalization and central neck dissection. In 14 patients the tumor was multifocal and in 12 of these patients the tumor foci were bilateral. The lesion was a microcarcinoma in 34 cases. Mean diameter of the ITC was 1.14 cm. We retrospectively reconsidered the results of preoperative ultrasound examinations in relation to the exact position of the tumor in the specimens and we found a statistically significant association between echogenicity and papillary histotype. Twenty-six patients were followed up at our Hospital. The mean follow-up period was 38.2 months. A relapse was observed in 3/26 patients. Incidental thyroid cancer in patients operated for benign disease has its own surgical and oncological relevance. A correct preoperative assessment, with a careful selection of nodules for fine-needle aspiration cytology on the basis of ultrasound pattern, could better address the choice of surgical procedure. The non irrelevant incidence of incidental thyroid cancer, the eventuality of multifocality and bilaterality and the possible occurrence of relapse, support that total thyroidectomy without residuum is a valuable option for treating benign thyroid conditions such as multinodular goitre. When an incidental cancer is diagnosed after emithyroidectomy, a radicalization with central neck dissection could be considered. We suggest that natural history of papillary microtumors and the correct surgical approach for these lesions could be better defined with a more extensive use of "Porto proposal" criteria.

T1  - Pathways to the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in New South Wales: a population-based cross-sectional study
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past few decades, an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer has been recorded in many countries around the world including Australia. Heightened medical surveillance and increased technological sensitivity could be contributing to greater detection of asymptomatic disease.OBJECTIVES: To describe the pathways to diagnosis of thyroid cancer for a cohort of newly diagnosed patients in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and compare these pathways by age, sex, place of residence, ethnic background, medical insurance status, and disease characteristics.METHODS: A total of 452 newly diagnosed cases of thyroid cancer were recruited through the population-based NSW Central Cancer Registry. Participants completed a questionnaire and diary of doctor visits and investigations that led to their diagnosis. Tumor characteristics were obtained from pathology reports.RESULTS: Forty percent of patients initially presented to their doctor with a lump or symptom specific to thyroid cancer and 60% had their cancer detected incidentally during a medical encounter. Men were more likely than women to be diagnosed after imaging for another health concern versus reporting a thyroid lump or symptom (p = 0.001). Thyroid cancer diagnosis after imaging for another health concern increased with age (p = 0.023), and larger tumors were less likely to be diagnosed after treatment for a benign thyroid disease (p = 0.040).CONCLUSION: As the majority of participants had incidental diagnoses, the reported incidence of thyroid cancer is likely to be influenced by diagnostic technology and medical surveillance practices. This, however, probably only partly explains the observed rise in the incidence of thyroid cancer in NSW.

T1  - The increasing incidence of small thyroid cancers: where are the cases coming from?
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To identify the trigger events that lead to the detection of otherwise asymptomatic thyroid cancers.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.METHODS: Chart abstraction of patients who underwent thyroidectomy. Iterative development of a classification algorithm to categorize trigger events.RESULTS: A total of 279 thyroidectomies were performed, which resulted in 95 new diagnoses of thyroid cancer. Just less than half of identified cancers (44 cancers, 46%) were in the 127 thyroidectomies performed after identification of a thyroid abnormality by either screening or chance. A screening trigger event occurs when a physician performs a routine thyroid examination when there is no specific neck complaint. A chance trigger event can occur either by serendipity (a radiologic test done for a different reason) or by diagnostic cascade (identification of a thyroid abnormality on any test that does not plausibly explain the patient's presenting complaint). Physician screening examination was the trigger event for 49 thyroidectomies (18%). Serendipity was the trigger event for 41 thyroidectomies (15%). Diagnostic cascade was the trigger event for 33 thyroidectomies (12%). Only 75 thyroidectomies (27%) were performed because of symptoms directly referable to a neck mass, such as a patient complaint of feeling something in the neck. Forty percent received a cancer diagnosis (30 of 75 cases).CONCLUSIONS: Screening and chance identification were the trigger events for just less than half of both the cancers diagnosed and the thyroidectomies performed. These extra cancer diagnoses and surgeries are a significant burden for patients. These data will help direct future efforts to curb treatment of clinically unimportant thyroid nodules.

T1  - [Incidental carcinoma in thyroid pathology: our experience and review of the literature]
AB  - The diagnosis of incidental thyroid carcinoma in patients submitted to thyroidectomy for a benign disease is quite frequent. A retrospective analysis was performed on 240 patients submitted to surgical intervention in order to establish the incidence of the carcinoma. One hundred sixty five patients (68.75%) were affected by benign disease (132 multinodular goiter, 30 uninodular goiter, 2 Plummer and 1 Basedow) and 75 (31.25%) by carcinoma. In 30 of 165 patients (18.2 %), affected by benign disease, occurred a histological diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma, (18 papillary carcinoma, 6 follicular carcinoma, 5 papillary carcinoma follicular variant and 1 oncocytic carcinoma). In this study it's considered incidental thyroid carcinoma the one occurred in patients who never underwent FNA and there were no suspicious features in all exams that may suggest the presence of carcinoma. Fifteen of the 30 incidental carcinoma (50%) were microcarcinomas; in the other 13, dimensions were more than 1 cm, but less than 2 cm in 9 cases. Two patients had a synchronous carcinoma. Actually these patients are still in a follow up program and no recurrency of disease is occasionally observed. This study shows that the only way to put doubts on the real benignity of the disease is the fine needle aspiration; there are no other instruments that could let think about the occurrence of the carcinoma. Moreover in the majority of cases the incidental carcinoma is a microcarcinoma, it doesn't reach significant volume, may be not centered by a FNAB, but in must cases it's not really biologically aggressive.

T1  - [Incidental thyroid carcinoma: a multicentric experience]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years it has seen an increase of incidental thyroid carcinomas (ICs), most of the ICs are any microcarcinoma (MC). The term refers to a CT, predominantly papillary, and smaller than or equal to 1 cm. The MC is characterized by a papillary heterogeneous clinical behavior ranging from small outbreak discovered accidentally after surgery than the cancer that manifests clinically with lymph node metastases in the neck or rarely systemic.METHODS: From January 2007 to June 2009, 1507 patients for benign disease were subjected to surgery.RESULTS: Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of benignity in 1339 cases. In 168, however, we detected unexpected, incidental carcinoma (CI). In patients with CI receiving total surgery (TT), the next iteration we agree with the endocrinologist. In cases of lobectomia, was run TT and was heading endocrinology. Of the 168 patients with incidental CT, 147 had papillary carcinomas, 12 follicular carcinomas, 5 follicular variant papillary carcinomas, 2 oncocytic carcinomas, 1 uncertain malignancy.CONCLUSION: In our study has highlighted the lack of data (medical history, ultrasound, scintigraphic), they may portend the presence of a tumor in the specimen CI. In all patients with CI, the surgical indication was given for symptomatic disease, for impairment of thyroid function, for failure to respond to medical therapy or unable to continue. The IC is almost always a microcarcinoma, predominantly papillary, and smaller than or equal to 1 cm, has little biological aggressiveness and is susceptible to metabolic radioiodine therapy. On the basis of these data we feel reasonably acceptable to a close follow-up endocrine surgery, particularly in patients with multinodular disease and stress the need for a multi-specialized team.

T1  - Improved detection does not fully explain the rising incidence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer: a population-based analysis
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing incidence of thyroid cancer may be an artifact of increased diagnostic scrutiny, permitting detection of smaller, subclinical thyroid cancers. Our objective was to examine trends in the incidence of well-differentiated thyroid cancers with large size and adverse pathological features.METHODS: Detailed population-based analysis of incidence trends in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (1973-2006) in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry, using weighted least squares and Joinpoint regression models.RESULTS: The incidence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) in the United States has tripled since 1973 (P < .0001). Incidence trends differ significantly between geographic regions and racial groups. Large WDTCs, including those >4 cm or >6 cm, have more than doubled in incidence (P < .0001). Cancers with extrathyroidal extension and with cervical metastases have also more than doubled in incidence (P < .0001).CONCLUSIONS: While the model of improving screening does explain increased diagnoses of small thyroid cancers, significant rises in the incidence of large cancers, and cancers with clinically significant pathological adverse features, are harder to explain. Alternative hypotheses, including a true increase in cancer incidence, would seem to merit exploration.

T1  - [Malignant thyroid neoplasms: a diagnostic challenge for ENT specialists]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thyroid carcinoma is frequently diagnosed incidentally during routine ENT examinations.METHODS: Symptoms and clinical findings of 40 patients with thyroid malignancies presenting in our department were analysed retrospectively. The aim was to define characteristics indicative for the final diagnosis of thyroid malignancy.RESULTS: In 48% the initial presentation was not because of thyroid-specific complaints, however during the course of the general ENT examination, unspecific thyroid pathology was detected and further evaluated using sonography, scintigraphy and fine needle biopsy (FNB). The results of scintigraphy were suspicious in 67% and FNB was positive in 30%, inconclusive in 30% and false negative in 40%. For suspected malignancies a rapid frozen section examination was carried out which was positive only in 60% and false negative or inconclusive in 20% each.CONCLUSION: Thyroid lesions incidentally found during ENT examination should undergo ultrasound examination, FNB and scintigraphy with the clear understanding that there is no single diagnostic feature leading to the correct diagnosis and that only the synopsis of various findings and sometimes only final histology leads to the correct diagnosis.

T1  - Epidemiology of thyroid nodules
AB  - Thyroid nodules are common and are commonly benign. The reported prevalence of nodular thyroid disease depends on the population studied and the methods used to detect nodules. Nodule incidence increases with age, and is increased in women, in people with iodine deficiency, and after radiation exposure. Numerous studies suggest a prevalence of 2-6% with palpation, 19-35% with ultrasound, and 8-65% in autopsy data. With widespread use of sensitive imaging in clinical practice, incidental thyroid nodules are being discovered with increasing frequency. Ultrasonography is the most accurate and cost-effective method for evaluating and observing thyroid nodules. Current ultrasonography machines are relatively inexpensive, sensitive, and easy to operate. Most endocrinologists are now using ultrasound examination in the initial evaluation of a patient with known or suspected thyroid nodule. The management of thyroid incidentalomas is a matter of controversy. [References: 39]

T1  - The Canadian Pediatric Thyroid Nodule Study: an evaluation of current management practices
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Thyroid nodules in children often require surgical treatment. We evaluated management practices for these across Canada.METHODS: Patient records from 9 Canadian pediatric centers of children undergoing surgery for thyroid nodules over a 6-year period were reviewed. Demographics, presenting features, investigations, surgical treatment, pathology, and complications were assessed.RESULTS: One hundred and forty-one patients were reviewed (75% female), of whom 117 presented with a palpable mass. Ultrasound and/or thyroid scintigraphy was the most commonly used preoperative imaging studies. Fine-needle aspiration cytology correlated with final pathology in 49% of cases. Overall, the rate of malignancy in this series was 43%, with half being papillary carcinoma. Thirty-two of 57 patients undergoing primary total thyroidectomy had a malignancy; 14 of these had positive preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytologies. Twenty of 71 patients undergoing initial hemithyroidectomy +/- isthmusectomy had a malignancy. Seventeen of these went on to completion thyroidectomy and 3 had malignancy in the second specimen. Hypocalcemia and hoarseness occurred in 14 and 4 patients, respectively. Complications were more common after primary total thyroidectomy; none occurred in patients undergoing completion thyroidectomy.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of malignancy in pediatric thyroid nodules is high, and the risk of surgical complications significant. With variable management practices across Canada, evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and surgical treatment may be valuable.

T1  - Incidental papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid
AB  - Papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) is a thyroid tumor measuring 10mm or less in maximum diameter and comprise up to 30% of all papillary thyroid cancers. Most of them are detected incidentally and defined as incidental papillary microcarcinoma (IPC<or=10mm). The incidence of such incidental cancers found in surgical specimens of benign thyroid diseases is high. Although most PMC are incidental, all incidental papillary cancers cannot be classified as microcarcinoma, owing to their size that may be larger than 10mm. Not much is known about the biological behavior and clinical course of IPC<or=10mm. There is an ongoing discussion among endocrinologists, endocrine surgeons and nuclear medicine specialists about the optimal therapeutic strategy for the patients with IPC<or=10mm. Some investigators advocate in favor of not performing further treatment in addition to initial thyroid surgery, whereas others suggest an aggressive surgical approach followed by radioiodine ablation therapy. Randomized prospective trials of observation versus standard thyroid cancer care are required to high-lighten this dilemma. [References: 27]

T1  - Thyroid incidentalomas
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the general population varies according to the method of detection in use. In large population studies, about 5% of subjects have palpable thyroid nodules, while autopsy studies reveal a 49-57% prevalence of thyroid nodules that were asymptomatic during life, and thyroid ultrasonography (US) shows a 13-50% prevalence in the general population. The increased sensitivity of many imaging modalities has led, in turn, to increased detection of subclinical thyroid nodules and of small, nonpalpable incidentalomas, and a diagnostic approach to patients with these nodules is briefly summarized.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of thyroid nodules discovered by US, clinically relevant thyroid malignancy remains rare and can be managed conservatively in most cases.

T1  - Thyroid cancer detected by mass screening over a period of 16 years at a health care center in Japan
AB  - PURPOSE: I studied the incidence and characteristics of thyroid cancers detected during mass screening over a period of 16 years at a health care center.METHODS: The subjects were 88 160 people (48 232 men and 39 928 women) who visited Kochi Kenshin Clinic between January 1989 and March 2005. Each person was initially examined by inspection and manipulation of the thyroid glands, then by ultrasonography if there were abnormal thyroid findings. They were referred to a surgeon specializing in thyroid surgery, depending on the ultrasonographic findings.RESULTS: Malignant thyroid tumors were detected in 204 subjects (62 men and 142 women), resulting in a detection rate of 0.44% (men 0.24%: women 0.69%) for absolute subjects (25,797 men: 20,636 women). This was considered favorable compared with other reported results of thyroid examinations using ultrasonography. The rates of cancer in nodular lesions and metastasis were higher in men than in women.CONCLUSION: Manipulation is adequate as an initial screening method for thyroid examination, and ultrasonography may not always be required. Moreover, it is necessary to consider gender when referring a patient to a specialist and when deciding on the indications for surgery to remove a thyroid tumor.

T1  - Increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States, 1973-2002
AB  - CONTEXT: Increasing cancer incidence is typically interpreted as an increase in the true occurrence of disease but may also reflect changing pathological criteria or increased diagnostic scrutiny. Changes in the diagnostic approach to thyroid nodules may have resulted in an increase in the apparent incidence of thyroid cancer.OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in thyroid cancer incidence, histology, size distribution, and mortality in the United States.METHODS: Retrospective cohort evaluation of patients with thyroid cancer, 1973-2002, using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and data on thyroid cancer mortality from the National Vital Statistics System.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thyroid cancer incidence, histology, size distribution, and mortality.RESULTS: The incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 3.6 per 100,000 in 1973 to 8.7 per 100,000 in 2002-a 2.4-fold increase (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-2.6; P<.001 for trend). There was no significant change in the incidence of the less common histological types: follicular, medullary, and anaplastic (P>.20 for trend). Virtually the entire increase is attributable to an increase in incidence of papillary thyroid cancer, which increased from 2.7 to 7.7 per 100,000-a 2.9-fold increase (95% CI, 2.6-3.2; P<.001 for trend). Between 1988 (the first year SEER collected data on tumor size) and 2002, 49% (95% CI, 47%-51%) of the increase consisted of cancers measuring 1 cm or smaller; 87% (95% CI, 85%-89%) consisted of cancers measuring 2 cm or smaller. Mortality from thyroid cancer was stable between 1973 and 2002 (approximately 0.5 deaths per 100,000).CONCLUSIONS: The increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States is predominantly due to the increased detection of small papillary cancers. These trends, combined with the known existence of a substantial reservoir of subclinical cancer and stable overall mortality, suggest that increasing incidence reflects increased detection of subclinical disease, not an increase in the true occurrence of thyroid cancer.

T1  - Surgical treatment of differentiated microcarcinomas of the thyroid
AB  - Thyroid microcarcinomas (TMC) are histologically malignant diseases, despite their limited dimensions and non-aggressive behaviour; frequent multifocality of the disease and local recurrence is really possible after conservative resection. Modern therapeutic approaches to thyroid microcarcinoma include both radical surgical treatment, influenced by the frequent locoregional diffusion of TMC, consisting of a total thyroidectomy with an eventual central and/or functional unilateral lymphadenectomy, depending on the clinical evidence of lymh node metastases and conservative treatment based on more limited resections which take into account the slow clinical progression of this type of tumour. The aim of our work is to examine the therapeutic guidelines for surgical treatment of TMC which, in our experience, are closely dependent on clinical presentation type. From 1991 to 2000, more than 400 patients with thyroid disease were referred to the Department of Surgical Science and Applied Medical Technologies "F. Durante". Threehundred-seventythree patients received surgical treatment: in 311 patients a benign disease was diagnosed, while in 62 neoplasia was present. In total we observed 30 TMC, consisting of 28 papillary and 2 follicular microcarcinomas. On the basis of clinical presentation we divided patients in three groups: A--patients with a clinically suspicious neoplastic lesion before surgical treatment; B--patients in whom histological diagnosis of cancer was "incidental" after an operation performed for benign disease; C--patients in whom a neck lymph node metastases were clinically found before diagnosis of an "occult" papillary carcinoma in the thyroid gland. 27 total thyroidectomies and 3 conservative resections, that required successive total exeresis, were performed. In 5 cases a central neck lymph node dissection was carried out and in 5 + 1 cases functional modified lateral neck dissections was deemed necessary. Our data suggest that an evaluation of tumor's malignancy cannot be carried out on the basis of its dimensions alone. Indeed, biological aggressivity, whether local or at a distance, is a prerogative of both large and small tumours. Therefore a microcarcinoma must be considered a full-blown form of thyroid cancer and as such must be treated. Total thyroidectomy may be followed by identification of possible local metastases. "Whole body" scintigraphy allows to identify and treat with radioiodine therapy, possible recurrent lesions. Therefore in conclusion, total resection is not only a useful, but also a necessary treatment for the correct diagnostic and therapeutic follow-up of these patients.

T1  - [Current possibilities of detection of thyroid cancer]
AB  - The article deals with 83 cases of carcinoma of the thyroid gland (CTG) which were recognized in 1973-1991 among the population during annual screening. The morbidity rate was 0.18 per 1,000 population, and increased by 3.4 times. Guidelines for Active Detection of Nodular Masses and Malignant Tumors of the Thyroid were elaborated. Their essence is as follows: during regular medical screening a group of individuals is distinguished in whom palpable abnormalities are found in the thyroid and focal changes are revealed in it by ultrasonic examination whose performance is recommended once every two years; the revealed group of individuals is subjected to complex examination for establishing the diagnosis, after which the tactics of their management are determined; a oncorisk group is formed to be kept under active observation. After introduction of the Guidelines into practice, recognition of CTG in stages I-II increased from 67.8 to 80%, which testifies to their effectiveness.

T1  - Nonpalpable occult and metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma
AB  - The results of palpation, ultrasound, and detailed pathology were compared in 50 patients undergoing total thyroidectomy. Of the 211 nodules recognized by pathology, palpation detected 24% and ultrasound detected 43%. There were 14 patients with palpable papillary carcinomas, and 12 of these 14 had metastatic foci in other portions of the gland. Metastatic foci would have been left in 10 patients if only a lobectomy had been performed and would have been left in 6 patients if only a subtotal thyroidectomy (as defined in this report) had been performed. Of the 33 patients with benign palpable nodules, 5 had occult papillary carcinomas. In 2 of those 5 patients, the occult carcinomas would not have been removed if a less-than-total thyroidectomy had been performed. The significance of these occult and metastatic papillary carcinomas is discussed.

T1  - [Preoperative examination of patients with thyroid nodules by high-resolution real-time ultrasonography]
AB  - Fifty patients with thyroid nodules were examined by high-resolution real-time ultrasonography (US) before surgery. Of this series, the sonographic features of 54 nodules in 41 cases were classified according to internal echogenicity, cystic components, margin, sound transmission, anterior extra-thyroid extension, and peripheral "halo" sign. Except for the last, the differences between benign and malignant nodules were statistically significant (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 or P < 0.001). The comparisons of US and palpation examination (PE) with postoperative pathological findings were undertaken in these 50 cases, respectively. The sensitivity and accuracy for US were much higher than those for PE (sensitivity, 97% vs. 77%; accuracy, 97% vs. 76%). Our results show that by analyzing some sonographic characteristics, it may be possible to differentiate benign from malignant lesions and owing to its higher sensitivity and accuracy, ultrasonography is a better choice of the scrutiny into thyroidal gland.

T1  - [Post-operative examination of 2930 thyroid glands: observations on primary carcinoma. Incidental carcinoma and the preoperative diagnostic assessment of thyroidectomy for cancer]
AB  - The histological examinations performed in our Institute in the years 1985-1991 and concerning thyroid diseases pertain to 2930 patients. These were considered clinically benign in 2463 cases and malignant in 467. After histological control, the actually benign cases resulted to be 2335, whereas carcinomas were 588 (495 papillary, 61 follicular, 17 anaplastic, 15 medullary). Six lymphomas and 1 fibrosarcoma have been also observed. A comparison between clinical and morphological diagnosis for thyroids thought to be clinically benign has shown a diagnostic overlapping of 93.8%, with absolute agreement for Basedow's diseases, whereas thyroiditis is the disease most often not diagnosed preoperatively. Incidental carcinomas were 132, with an attendance related directly to the number of samples randomly taken from the surgical specimen. In 538 cases of carcinoma it has been possible to evaluate the intraglandular spread of the tumor: bilateral multifocal cases were 18.4%, with an incidence of latero-cervical metastases (41.4%) nearly twice as that observed in monolateral cases (24.2%). Post-surgical examination of the whole gland in 381 patients treated with a total thyroidectomy for carcinoma has discovered 20 false positive cases: 11 were operated on only according to clinical and instrumental examinations, 2 on the basis of just the cytological results, and 7 on the basis of cytologically positive evidence though refuted by intraoperative frozen sections. In the 381 cases taken into account, intraoperative frozen sections have been done 256 times: the results have been confirmed by the histological post-surgical examination of the whole gland in 94.5% of the cases. No false positive cases did occur. False negative cases were 7, due to inadequate sampling (in the operating room or in the pathology lab). Delayed diagnoses were 4, whereas truly false negative cases have been in all 3 (1.2%). The greater part of our data has been disaggregated in two different periods (1985-1988 and 1989-1991) to point out any change with time in the parameters under observation. The most relevant reflections relating to the time were the following: (1) per cent increase of bilateral multifocal carcinomas (13.9 vs. 21.8%), (2) per cent decrease of latero-cervical metastases in monolateral carcinomas (31.8 vs 17.7%), (3) frank decrease in the median value of incidental carcinomas' diameters (2.2 cm in the first vs. 0.6 cm in the last year), (4) frank decrease of false positive cases among patients operated on without prior cytological or histological verification (6/21 vs. 1/27), (5) remarkable improvement of the rate of correlation between intraoperative frozen section diagnosis and post-surgical histological examination (92.1 vs. 97.4%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 27]

T1  - The role of fine needle aspiration in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules: analysis of 795 consecutive cases
AB  - The utility of fine needle aspiration (FNA) and physical examination for selecting patients with palpable thyroid nodules for surgery was evaluated in 795 consecutive cases. Surgery was performed in 216 patients based upon the cytological diagnosis and clinical criteria. Excluding 42 patients who were lost to follow-up, the remaining 537 were regularly followed up (range, 2-10 years). Cytological findings were classified as malignant, histologic control recommended (suspicious), follicular tumor, benign, and unsatisfactory. Thirty-six aspiration biopsies were positive for malignancy and the diagnosis was confirmed histologically in 34 of them. In 65 patients with final histological diagnosis of malignancy, cytology was positive in 34, suspicious in 20, benign in 3 cases, and unsatisfactory in 8. All patients with cytological diagnosis of follicular tumor had a benign lesion at histology. There were two false positive and three false negative cytological results among the 216 histologically confirmed cases. Excluding unsatisfactory specimen sensitivity, specificity and the predictive value for a positive and a negative result were respectively 95%, 97.5%, 94.5%, and 97%. We conclude that FNA is a very reliable diagnostic test in the evaluation of thyroid nodules and is the best guidance in addition to clinical criteria for selecting patients to be submitted to surgery.

T1  - [Surgical tactics in the treatment of thyroid nodular pathology]
AB  - The thyroid nodules represent the most frequent endocrinopathy, because clinically palpable nodules are detectable in 4-5% of the general population. Such pathological condition includes adenomas, carcinoma, intraglandular haematomas or cysts, focal thyroiditis, etc. Fine-needle aspiration cytology allows a correct diagnosis in about 90% of the cases, distinguishing focal thyroiditis from nodular goiter or thyroid malignancies. The new instrumental and cytological studies make the choice for surgical interventions more selective. At the Institution of General and Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Milan, 597 patients underwent surgery from 1966 to January 1988. The observed nodular (toxic or non toxic) thyropathies were 498 (83.4%). Cold nodules represented about a third (34%) of the nodular thyropathies. Thyroid carcinomas were 33 (5.6%). This study is aimed to analyze our surgical attitude with respect to nodular thyropathies, the surgical procedures adopted and the observed complications.

T1  - Evaluation of mass screening for thyroid cancer
AB  - Mass screening for detecting both thyroid and breast cancer in adult women was carried out in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, between 1980 and 1986. The total number of subjects during the seven years was 152,651. The first screening was by inspection and palpation using experienced surgeons. Thyroid abnormalities were found in 5,902 subjects (3.9%) and 3,804 (2.5%) were required to attend a second examination. Thyroid carcinoma was detected in a total of 216 subjects, a detection rate of 0.14%. The detection rate for thyroid cancer was twice as high at the initial screening (0.19%) than that at subsequent periodic screenings (0.09%). Histological classifications of the detected thyroid cancers were: papillary carcinoma, 189 cases (87.5%); follicular carcinoma, 26 (12%); medullary carcinoma, 1 (0.5%). Eighty-seven percent of the thyroid cancers were asymptomatic at the time of screening. The tumor size were 2 cm or less in 126 patients (58.3%). Thyroid cancer detected by mass screening was revealed at an earlier stage and showed a significantly better survival rate compared to that of our usual outpatients. As differentiated carcinoma has been found at a higher incidence by mass screening, the program is useful for the early detection and treatment of thyroid cancer.

T1  - Prediction of malignancy in the solitary thyroid nodule by physical examination, thyroid scan, fine-needle biopsy and serum thyroglobulin. A prospective study of 100 surgically treated patients
AB  - A prospective study was made of 100 consecutive patients selected for surgical treatment of a clinically solitary thyroid nodule. Anamnestic data and findings at physical examination, thyroid scan, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and measurement of serum thyroglobulin were correlated with the postoperative histologic diagnoses. The histologic findings were malignant in 18 cases and benign in 82. Familial occurrence of benign goiter was reported more frequently by patients with benign than by those with malignant histology (46 and 11%). Of the 11 nodules that were hard at palpation, 7 were malignant. All 12 scintigraphically "hot" nodules were benign, but 13 of 59 "solitary, cold" nodules were malignant. The cytologic specimens were reviewed and reclassified. The needle aspirate was insufficient for cytologic diagnosis in 11 cases. Papillary carcinoma was cytologically recognized in four cases. Of 36 lesions cytologically reported to be neoplasm of unspecified type, 12 were histologically shown to be malignant, 20 were follicular adenomas and 4 were colloid goiter. Benign lesion was the cytologic diagnosis in 47 cases. One diagnosis was false negative, but the cancer lay beneath the index nodule. The thyroglobulin level was significantly higher in patients with thyroid cancer than in those with benign disorders, but the test's predictive value was low. Thyroglobulin levels more than tenfold the upper limit of normal were found only in three patients with thyroid cancer and two with thyrotoxicosis. Although all of the mentioned investigative data were helpful in the management of solitary thyroid nodule, fine-needle biopsy was the best single method. When cytologic examination shows malignancy or unspecified neoplasm, surgery is indicated. For most patients with cytologically benign lesions, careful follow-up will suffice.

T1  - Diagnostic pathways in a population-based sample of differentiated thyroid cancer patients
AB  - Introduction: The US Preventive Task Force (USPTF) recommended against screening for thyroid cancer with palpation or thyroid ultrasound in asymptomatic adults. However, the proportion of patients currently diagnosed with thyroid cancer secondary to palpation or ultrasound remains unknown. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate how patients in the United States are being diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Design, Setting, Patients: This is a cross-sectional, population-based survey of patients diagnosed with DTC in 2014-2015 at Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) sites Georgia and Los Angeles. This survey was administered from February 2017 to present using a modified Dillman survey method. Final follow up will continue until early summer 2018. Results: Of 1135 patients completing the survey, 877 (78%) were female and 762 (67%) were white. Median age was 54.0 years (range 21-83). Of the patients surveyed, 393 (35%) reported that their nodule was detected by their doctor during physical exam, 262 (23%) reported that they felt their nodule themselves, 212 (19%) reported that their nodule was found on an imaging test other than thyroid ultrasound, 181(16%) reported that their nodule was detected with thyroid ultrasound, and 74 (7%) never knew they had a thyroid nodule. A total of 1007 (90%) went on to have a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of their nodule. In 644 (57%) of the patients thyroid surgery was subsequently scheduled because their doctor thought their nodule may be cancer whereas 295 (26%) had surgery because of an indeterminate nodule, 192 (17%) because of a large goiter, 134 (12%) because of compressive symptoms, 92 (8%) as treatment for hyperthyroidism, and 71 (6%) as treatment for a benign nodule. Out of the entire cohort, 98 (9%) of patients had a history of radiation exposure. In 106 (9%) of the patients there was one first degree relative with DTC, and 29 (3%) had 2 or more first degree relatives with DTC. A total of 341 (30%) had 5 or more doctor visits in the year prior to the diagnosis of DTC whereas 557 (50 %) had 2 to 4 visits, 171 (15%) had one visit and 54 (5%) reported no visit prior to the DTC diagnosis. Conclusion: In this cohort of patients diagnosed with DTC, more than half of the patients report that their thyroid nodule was originally detected by either doctor palpation or thyroid ultrasound. Per patient report, screening by doctor palpation or thyroid ultrasound is a major contributor to the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. These findings suggest that wide spread adoption of the USPTF recommendations will change the landscape of thyroid cancer in the United States.

T1  - Differentiated thyroid carcinoma - Preoperative diagnostics and its impact on surgical approach
AB  - Ziel/Aim: Postoperative incidentally diagnosed differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC) can require reoperations with increased risk of morbidity. This investigation should reveal the prediction value of preoperative thyroid nodule dignity assessment and its impact on surgical approaches. Methodik/Methods: Retrospective analysis of 107 DTC cases with the necessity of adjuvant radioiodine therapy, subdivided into three groups based on the preoperative dignity assessment of the referring physicians: suspected malignancy (SM), unclear dignity (UD), and incidental findings (IF). The group differences were investigated in terms of diagnostic methods, findings, and impact on the subsequent operative therapy. Ergebnisse/Results: The patient groups consisted of 51 (SM), 32 (UD), and 24 (IF). The tumor size and the T staging had the largest impact on dignity classification, larger tumors more frequently have been seen in SM group (p < 0.001). Ultrasound (US), sctinigraphy and biopsy have been performed in 100 %, 77 % and 28 %, respectivly. US assesment, Hypofunction at scintigraphy (each p < 0.001) and cytology results (p < 0.01) were identified as significant predictors for group assignment of the referring physicians. Furthermore the frequency of the documentation of US nodule characteristics (p < 0.001) and malignancy criteria (p < 0.01) as well as reduced thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (p < 0.01) had an impact on the nodule dignity assesment. Frozen section (p < 0.001) and total thyroidectomy (p < 0.01) at initial surgery were performed significantly more often in the MV group. Reoperations were significantly more frequent in the IF group (p < 0.001). Schlussfolgerungen/Conclusions: More than half of the DTC cases have not been correctly predicted by preoperative diagnostics, leading to significantly more frequent reoperations in cases of incidental findings. A more systematic diagnostic approach according to current guidelines with complete documentation of the findings and a correlative assesment of the diagnostic methods should be pursued.

T1  - Causes of referral to the first endocrine visit of patients with thyroid carcinoma in a mildly iodine-deficient area
AB  - To evaluate the causes of the first referral to an endocrine visit of patients with thyroid cancer in a mildly iodine-deficient area and to correlate them with prognostic features. We studied 298 consecutive patients (64 M and 234 F) with thyroid cancer. Of these, 281 had differentiated thyroid cancer. The causes of referral were categorized as follows: (Group A) clinical evidence of a neck lump; (Group B) incidental imaging in subjects without known thyroid diseases; (Group C) incidental imaging during a workup of thyroid disorders. Also, in differentiated thyroid cancer cases, clinical, histomorphologic, and prognostic parameters were compared among the three different groups of referral causes. In both total thyroid cancer and differentiated thyroid cancer cohorts, Group A, B, and C accounted for about 25, 35, and 40 % of causes, respectively. Considering the differentiated thyroid cancer, in Group B, ultrasound accounted for 94 % of cases, with 73 % resulting from screening or serendipitous study. Within a median follow-up of 5.6 [IQR: 2.7-9.5] years, disease-free survival was significantly lower in patients of Group A (Log-Rank test p = 0.030 vs. the other groups of causes). However, at the Cox multivariate analysis only male sex (p = 0.002) and stage (p = 0.005), but not referral cause, resulted independent predictors of events. In patients without known thyroid disease, unjustified thyroid ultrasound represents the main cause of referral of thyroid cancer patients to the first endocrine visit. The fact that this is not related to the disease-free survival strengthens the concept of the uselessness of thyroid cancer screening. Copyright © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

T1  - Revisiting types and risk factors for thyroid malignancy in a state endemic of iodine deficiency goiter
AB  - Introduction: We have realized that recent rise in incidence of thyroid malignancy is partly because of incidental findings of cancer after resection for benign goiters. Therefore, we aim to reanalyze risk factors for thyroid malignancy in those patients who underwent primary thyroid surgery at Breast and Endocrine Surgical Unit, Department of Surgery, Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II, Kota Bharu, Kelantan, Malaysia. Materials and methods: Retrospective review in our database found 699 patients who had undergone thyroid surgeries between June 2007 and December 2014. According to the final histopathological report of resected specimen, these patients, operated for goiter, were divided into two groups: Thyroid malignancy group and nonmalignancy group. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of age, duration and weight of resected specimen for having thyroid malignancy. Results: The mean value for age was 43.5 years [standard deviation (SD) = 14.0); duration of neck swelling was 5.9 months (SD = 6.7); and weight of resected specimen was 157 gm (SD = 161.0). Around 26.9% cases had thyroid malignancy (n = 188), about 77.13% cases had papillary thyroid carcinoma and 17.6% had follicular thyroid carcinoma. Age associates with risk for malignancy (p < 0.001), but duration of neck swelling (p = 0.513) and weight of resected specimen (p = 0.955) do not relate with this. With an increase of 1 year of age, the odds to have thyroid malignancy increase for 2%. This is equivalent with 14.4% increase in cancer for every 5-year increase in age. Conclusion: Our study has found that increasing age is the only associated factor for risk of thyroid malignancy. When managing elderly patients who has clinically benign goiter, differential diagnosis of thyroid cancer need be considered as well. Copyright © 2017, Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd.

T1  - Clinical and histopathological characteristics of patients with incidental and nonincidental thyroid cancer
AB  - Introduction: Thyroid nodules (TNs) are a common pathology. Their prevalence increases with age. Some of them are suspected of malignancy and qualified for surgery. Sometimes their malignant nature is detected incidentally after a surgical procedure. The aim of the study is to analyze clinical and histopathological characteristics of patients with incidental and nonincidental thyroid carcinoma (ITC vs. NITC). Material and methods: The case records of 3,241 patients with solitary and multiple TNs who were treated consecutively between 2008 and 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. After the final selection 235 (7.25%) patients were included in the study (202 females and 33 males, mean age: 52.9 +16.5 years). Seventy-five (31.91%) cases were incidentally diagnosed and 160 (68.09%) were diagnosed before surgery. Results: We did not observe any differences in age, gender or stage of disease at the time of diagnosis between the patients with ITC and NITC (p = 0.366, p = 0.850, p = 0.226 respectively). The occurrence of solitary nodules in patients with NITC was significantly higher compared to patients with ITC (p < 0.0001). There were no differences in histopathological types of thyroid cancer (TC). The logistic regression analysis showed that solitary TC was an independent predictor of NITC (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: There are no differences in gender, age or histopathological type of cancer in patients with ITC and NITC. Papillary TC is the predominant type in both groups. Incidence of TC in a solitary nodule is significantly higher in NITC than ITC. Solitary type of TC is an independent predictor of NITC. The prevalence of ITC is associated with multifocal type of TC.

T1  - Nonincidentally and incidentally discovered thyroid cancer
AB  - Introduction Increasing incidence of thyroid cancer might be a consequence of an increase detection of subclinical disease. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and pathologic characteristics of nonincidentally discovered (NID) thyroid cancer with incidentally discovered (ID) on postoperative pathology. Methods A retrospective medical record review of 102 patients with thyroid cancer was performed. A group I of 69 patients with NID thyroid cancer was compared with a group II of 33 patients with ID thyroid cancer. Results At diagnosis the mean age was 51.5 years for the group I and 56.6 years for the group II (p = 0.10). The rate of male was 18.8% in the group I and 12.1% in the group II (p = 0.39). Hashimoto's thyroiditis was present in 21.7% and 15.2% of patients in groups I and II, respectively (p = 0.53). Papillary tumor was the most frequent in both groups (87.0% in group I and 97.0% in group II). At TNM, stage III was present at a similar rate in both groups (I 21.7% and II 21.2%). There was no statistical difference in the mean size of tumor (p = 0.05), focality (p = 0.72), capsular involvement (p = .07) and lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.33). There weren't lymph nodes metastasis in group II compared with a rate of 11.6% in group I (p = 0.05). Radioactive iodine treatment was most frequent in group I (68.1% vs 45.5%) p = 0.03. Conclusions There weren't significant differences in the age, sex, presence of thyroiditis, size of tumor, focality, capsular or lymphovascular invasion between the groups. There was a similar rate of stage III in both groups, nevertheless the ID thyroid cancer seems to be biologically less aggressive than NID.

T1  - Pathologic scrutiny contributes to "epidemic" of thyroid cancer
AB  - Introduction: The incidence of thyroid cancer has tripled over the past 40 years while the mortality rate has remained constant. The escalating incidence is largely due to detection of small papillary thyroid cancers(PTCs). The most commonly discussed cause is widespread imaging. We speculate that an important contributor to the rising incidence of PTC is the pathological findings of incidental, non-index papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs) associated with benign thyroid surgery. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of consecutive patients who underwent thyroid surgery from 2007 to 2014 at a single academic institution. Medical records were reviewed to identify thyroid cancers and the nature by which they were diagnosed. Cancers were categorized as incidental if the surgery was done for anticipated benign disease or the index nodule was confirmed to be benign on fine needle aspiration (FNA). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Results: There were 1306 patients who underwent thyroid surgery during the study period. Thyroid cancer was diagnosed in 377 patients (28.8%). Among those patients with thyroid cancer, 181 (47.7%) had index cancers and 196 (51.9%) had incidental papillary thyroid cancers. Among the incidental papillary thyroid cancers, 4 (2.0%) were in patients with a benign FNA, and 20 (10.2%) had a FNA that revealed a follicular neoplasm or suspicious for follicular neoplasm. One hundred and thirty four of these incidental cancers (68.3%) were PTMCs and 2 of these were associated with lymph node metastasis. The mean size of the incidental papillary carcinomas was 0.90 cm. Conclusion: We found that incidental papillary thyroid cancer represents 51% of the cancers diagnosed at our institution; PTMCs constitute 68.3% of the total incidental PTCs discovered on review of surgical specimens from thyroid surgery for benign conditions. Incidental cancers are common and increased pathologic scrutiny may therefore be contributing to the epidemic of thyroid cancer. Incidental PTMCs are less likely to have lateral compartment nodal metastases than clinically presenting cancers. However, central compartment nodes are at least sometimes involved..

T1  - From South Korea to Ireland: The papillary thyroid cancer driven epidemic continues
AB  - Objective: The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing rapidly in most countries. This appears to be driven by the over-diagnosis of small papillary thyroid cancer. The aim of our study was to analyze the incidence of thyroid cancer in Ireland. Methods: We carried out a retrospective analysis of the Irish national cancer database between 1994 and 2012. Results: A total number of 2261 cancers of the thyroid gland were identified. The incidence increased from 1.6/100,000 in 1994 to 5.97/ 100,000 in 2011, an annual percentage change of 8.2 %. The risk of being diagnosed with thyroid cancer was 3.7 times greater in the later years (p<0.00001). The proportion of papillary thyroid cancer of the total number increased from 49 % in 1998 to 83 % in 2012. The number of T1-T3 tumours all increased whilst T4 tumours remained stable. Patients with early stage were found to have exceptional 5, 10 and 15-year overall survival rates at 98.7, 98.2 and 98.2 % respectively. Conclusions: Ireland has not been spared by the rise in thyroid cancer seen worldwide. There may be some increase in larger tumours but mainly the uncovering of small papillary thyroid cancers, which in all likelihood would have remained subclinical, drives this rise in incidence. The challenge in the future will be to identify those malignancies that will cause harm.

T1  - Demographic and clinical risk factors for thyroid cancer in Korea: Korean national health insurance database study
AB  - Korea has the highest incidence of thyroid cancer in the world, and thyroid cancer has become the most common cancer in Korea. We evaluated the associations between demographic and clinical factors and thyroid cancer risk. Prospective cohort data of 1,025,340 subjects were collected from the National Health Insurance Service in Korea during 2002-2010. The cohort data represented about 2.2% of the source population in 2002 (n = 46,605,433) and was sampled systematically to represent an individual's total annual medical expenses within each of 1,476 strata defined by age, sex, eligibility status (employed or self-employed), and income level combinations. Cox regression analysis was done using sex, age, socioeconomic status (SES), smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), and underlying thyroid disease as independent variables. A total of 3,567 new thyroid cancers were detected during the 8- year of follow-up. The risk for thyroid cancer was higher in females (HR, 3.83; 95% CI, 3.41-4.31), with higher SES (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.34-1.56) than those at a mid-SES level. Compared with subjects with BMIs of 23.0-25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the risk was higher in females with BMIs of 26.5-28.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.05- 1.38) and males with BMIs of 28.0-30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.07-1.96) and 30.0-32.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.29-2.92). The risk was significantly lower in subjects whose BMI was below 21.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Interestingly, current smokers had a lower risk than non-smokers (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.51-0.71); additionally, frequent drinkers ( >= 3 times/week) and those who drank less than twice/ week had a lower risk than non-drinkers (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73- 0.87 and HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53-0.75). Thyroid cancer risk was higher in subjects with hypothyroidism (HR, 4.42; 95% CI, 3.62- 5.39) and thyrotoxicosis/hyperthyroidism (HR, 3.85; 95% CI, 3.52-4.21) status than in those without. These patterns were consistent in male and female subjects, but were more significant in male subjects. The higher incidence of thyroid cancer in the high-SES group could reflect incidental detection due to more frequent health checkups; however, we also identified modifiable risk factors which have public health implications.

T1  - Increased thyroid cancer incidence corresponds to increased utilization of thyroid ultrasound and fine needle aspiration: A population-based study in the veterans affairs healthcare system
AB  - Thyroid cancer incidence has increased sharply in the last several decades, and it is unclear whether this represents a true incidence increase or increased diagnosis and screening. The purpose of this study is to examine the association between thyroid cancer incidence and utilization of thyroid ultrasound (US) and fine needle aspiration (FNA) in the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system. We hypothesize that increases in thyroid cancer incidence rates correspond to increases in use of these diagnostic modalities. Nationwide multi-year cross-sectional study using VA administrative data from 2000 to 2012. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify trends in thyroid cancer incidence and the utilization of thyroid US and FNA. Thyroid cancer incidence increased from 10.3/100,000 in 2000 to 21.5/100,000 in 2012. Utilization of thyroid US increased from 123.1/ 100,000 in 2001 to 572.1/100,000 in 2012, while rates of thyroid FNA increased from7.0/100,000 in 2000 to 46.2/100,000 in 2012. On joinpoint regression analysis, a statistically significant increase in thyroid cancer incidence between 2000 and 2008 (Annual Percent Change (APC) =3.81, p< 0.05)was followed by a more pronounced increase between 2008 and 2012 (APC= 10.32, p< 0.05). A statistically significant increase in thyroid US occurred between 2002 and 2012 (APC=15.48, p<0.05) and in thyroid FNA between 2000 and 2012 (APC = 18.36, p< 0.05). This is the first study to demonstrate a direct association between thyroid cancer incidence and utilization of thyroid US and FNA within a single integrated healthcare system. While thyroid cancer incidence nearly doubled, a nearly fivefold increase in utilization of thyroid US and a nearly sevenfold increase in use of FNA occurred between 2000 and 2012. These findings suggest that the increase in thyroid cancer incidence in the VA population may reflect an over-diagnosis of subclinical disease as a result of overutilization of thyroid US screening and FNA.

T1  - Markedly increased incidence of thyroid cancer in northeast pennsylvania: A clinical-epidemiological investigation
AB  - Purpose/Objective(s): Thyroid cancer incidence in the United States has increased nearly three-fold in the past thirty years. In northeast Pennsylvania, the incidence of thyroid cancer is more than 50% higher than SEER rate. It is unclear to what extent this disparity is due to small lesions detected incidentally during imaging for non-thyroid conditions. The objectives of this research are to document the incidence of thyroid cancer in northeast Pennsylvania and to explore factors that may explain the disparity in incidence in this region. Materials/Methods: Data fromthe Pennsylvania Cancer Registry were used to examine the incidence of thyroid cancer in the most recent five year period. The expected number of incident thyroid cancer cases in northeast Pennsylvania was computed by applying the age- and sex- specific incidence rates from NCI's SEER program to the population of northeast Pennsylvania. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for thyroid cancer (overall and by sex) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were computed. In addition, medical records of 393 thyroid cancer patients treated at our institution were selected for review, of which 383 were suitable for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with incidental diagnosis. Continuous variables were evaluated by t-test, and categorical data were evaluated using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analyses. Results: During 1995-96, 51 cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed per year in northeast Pennsylvania; by 2010, the number had grown to 171. The SIR for cases diagnosed in 2006-2010 for both sexes combined was 1.58 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.69). Among men, the SIR was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.08-1.48); among women, it was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.55-181). Among subjects whose records were reviewed, the mean age was 46.1 years, 319 (83%) were female, 359 (94%) were white, 349 (91%) had papillary or follicular variant tumors, mean tumor size was 1.97 cm, and 269 (70.2%) were diagnosed at Stage 1. Only 71 (18.5%) were detected incidentally during a medical evaluation for another condition, 302 (78.8%)were diagnosed because of signs or symptoms of thyroid disease. Tumor size alone predicted incidental diagnosis. For tumors>=1.5 cm, themultivariateORwas 0.38 (95%CI 0.19-0.72). Conclusions: This study confirms a recent increase in the risk of thyroid cancer in northeast Pennsylvania and disparity in risk compared to national figures. Incidental tumors are unlikely to account for these differences, as the vast majority of patients were symptomatic when first seen. Further investigation is needed to identify factors contributing to the high risk of thyroid cancer in this community.

T1  - A preoperative diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer: Incidence and implications
AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of patients with histologic PTC who were successfully identified preoperatively by current diagnostic modalities, and to evaluate if a preoperative PTC diagnosis has prognostic implications. Methods: We performed a retrospective single institution review of 1088 consecutive patients with histologic PTC from 2007-2012. Patients with incidentally identified microPTC (<=1 cm) were excluded. Successful preoperative PTC diagnosis was defined by a fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) cytology classified as "Positive for PTC," or the presence of BRAFV600E mutation or RET/PTC rearrangement after prospective mutation testing (MT) of cytologically indeterminate FNAB specimens. Results: Apreoperative PTC diagnosis occurred in 50% of patients, and was diagnosed by cytology in 32% and by positive MT in 18%. When PTC was known preoperatively, patients were more likely to have a smaller primary tumor (1.8 v. 2.0 cm, p=.03), extrathyroidal extension (ETE, 38% v. 10%, p<.001), central compartment lymph node metastasis (CLNM, 47% v. 20%, p<.001), and tall-cell variant PTC (15% v. 4%, p<.001). TNM stage III/IV disease was more common in patients diagnosed preoperatively with a trend towards significance (28% v. 21%, p=.05), yet no differences in distant metastasis or recurrence were observed. Patients with microPTC identified preoperatively were more likely to have ETE (21% v. 4%, p<.001) or CLNM (46% v. 5%, p<.001) compared to those who had a postoperative cancer diagnosis. ETE (34% v. 16%, p<.001) was more common in patients diagnosed by cytology compared to those diagnosed by MT, but patients in both groups were equally likely to have CLNM (p=0.5) andTNM stage III/IV disease (p=.6). Conclusion:Asuccessful preoperative diagnosis of PTC occurred in only half of patients with histologic PTC. The use of routine preoperative adjunctive mutation testing successfully increased this likelihood by 40%.Apreoperative diagnosis was associated with PTC with aggressive histopathologic features thus regardless of tumor size, at a minimum, total thyroidectomy should be considered in patients with a preoperative PTC diagnosis.

T1  - Incidental versus clinically evident thyroid cancer: A 5-year follow-up study
AB  - Background The incidence of differentiated thyroid cancer in patients undergoing surgery for presumed benign thyroid disease (incidental thyroid cancer) is not negligible. The purpose of this study was to verify if incidental thyroid cancers have a different clinical course than the clinically evident thyroid cancer. Methods A group of patients with incidental thyroid cancer (n = 95) has been compared to a control group with clinically evident thyroid cancer (n = 93). Both the histology and the outcome after a 5-year follow-up have been compared. Results At the univariate analysis, the groups demonstrated significant differences in many pathologic features, remnant ablation (p <.001), and persistent disease (p =.006). Nevertheless, the multivariate analysis revealed that the outcome was not influenced by the preoperative or the incidental diagnosis. Conclusion Incidental thyroid cancers show a different pathological pattern when compared to clinically evident thyroid cancers. Nonetheless, the final outcome is not influenced by preoperative or postoperative diagnosis. Hence, patients with incidental thyroid cancer should follow the same postoperative protocols of patients with clinically evident thyroid cancer. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background To provide population-based estimates of trends in thyroid nodule fine-needle aspirations (FNA) and operative volumes, we used multiple claims databases to quantify rates of these procedures and their association with the increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States. Method Private and public insurance claims databases were used to estimate procedure volumes from 2006 to 2011. Rates of FNA and thyroid operations related to thyroid nodules were defined by CPT4 codes associated with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Clinical Modification codes for nontoxic uni- or multinodular goiter and thyroid neoplasms. Results Use of thyroid FNA more than doubled during the 5-year study period (16% annual growth). The number of thyroid operations performed for thyroid nodules increased by 31%. Total thyroidectomies increased by 12% per year, whereas lobectomies increased only 1% per year. In 2011, total thyroidectomies accounted for more than half (56%) of the operations for thyroid neoplasms in the United States. Thyroid operations became increasingly (62%) outpatient procedures. Conclusion Thyroid FNA and operative procedures have increased rapidly in the United States, with an associated increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer. The more substantial increase in number of total versus partial thyroid resections suggests that patients undergoing thyroid operation are perceived to have a greater risk of cancer as determined by preoperative assessments, but this trend could also increase detection of incidental microcarcinomas. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

T1  - Differentiated thyroid cancer - Clinical presentation as a prognostic variable
AB  - Background The incidence of differentiated thyroid cancer has increased from 1.3/100,000 for women and 4.6/100,000 for men (1935) to 16.3/100,000 for women and 5.6/100,000 for men (2008).1 This increase is primarily driven by papillary thyroid carcinoma.2 However, thyroid cancer mortality has remained stable.3,4 This suggests that cancers that might remain subclinical in a patientTMs lifetime are being detected and treated. A recent retrospective study revealed that only 27% of thyroidectomy procedures at one center were performed because of symptoms related to a thyroid mass.5 Current American Thyroid Association guidelines on indication for thyroid nodule biopsy do not take into account how the thyroid nodule was detected.6 A number of classification systems have been developed to estimate disease specific mortality from differentiated thyroid cancer. The MACIS (metastasis, age, completeness of resection, invasion, size) system7 is widely accepted and validated.8It is not known whether the manner in which the thyroid cancer presented has prognostic significance. Hypothesis Differentiated thyroid cancers detected incidentally carry a favourable prognosis. Methods Retrospective study utilizing the thyroid cancer database at St PaulTMs Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Records of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were reviewed to identify the initial event(s) that lead to diagnosis of thyroid cancer, and grouped into 3 categories 1) Incidental imaging. 2) Incidental physical exam finding. 3) Patient presents with complaints possibly related to thyroid mass. MACIS system was used to calculate a prognostic score reflecting 20 yr disease specific survival in each category: MACIS < 6: 99% , MACIS 6-6.99: 89%, MACIS 7-7.99: 56%, MACIS 8+: 24%*. Results 162 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were reviewed. 22 (13%) of patients had incidental imaging as their initial event, 43 (27%) patients had cancer detected on incidental physical exam, and 72 (44%) patients presented with complaints related to thyroid mass. 25 (16%) patientsTM initial event was unknown. The distribution of MACIS score for patients in the "incidental imaging" category was: < 6 (76%), 6-6.99 (10%), 7-7.99 (10%), >8 (4%). Distribution of MACIS score for patients in the "incidental physical exam" category was: <6 (81%), 6-6.99 (10%), 7-7.99 (7%), >8 (2%). Distribution of MACIS score for patients in the "complaints related to thyroid mass" category was: <6 (77%), 6-6.99 (11%), 7-7.99 (6%), >8 (6%). The percentage of patients in each division of MACIS score among the 3 clinical presentation categories was statistically non-significant (P= 0.97). Conclusion Half of differentiated thyroid cancers are being detected incidentally. The manner in which differentiated thyroid cancer initially presents has no apparent relationship to prognosis.

T1  - Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma: Clinicopathological characteristics and implications for treatment in 276 patients
AB  - Background There is debate concerning the clinical significance of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), and therefore, the rise in the incidence of PTMC creates management dilemmas. The purpose of this study was to analyse the clinicopathological characteristics of PTMC in an island region that has a high prevalence of goitre and to determine risk factors for the worst prognosis. Materials and methods Data from 1874 patients who underwent a total thyroidectomy between January 2002 and December 2008 were reviewed retrospectively. A total of 276 patients who were diagnosed with PTMC in a final pathology report were included in the study. A PTMC was defined as a papillary thyroid carcinoma with a diameter <=10mm. Clinicopathological features were evaluated by both univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Of the 276 patients with PTMC, 219 patients (79.3%) were incidentally diagnosed. Two hundred and two patients had carcinomas of <=5mm, and 74 patients presented with carcinomas that ranged in size from 0.6 to 1.0cm. Lymph node metastasis was diagnosed in 3.5% of patients with tumours <=5mm, and 21.6% of patients presented tumours >5mm. Upon multivariate analysis, clinically suspected diagnosis, a tumour size >5mm and an age over 45years at diagnosis were independent risk factors for capsule invasion, while tumour multifocality, bilaterality, size of tumour >5mm and thyroid capsule invasion were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis at diagnosis. Conclusions Patients presenting multifocal, bilateral PTMC with a maximum diameter >5mm and thyroid capsule invasion may have an increased risk of lymph node metastasis. These factors should be considered in the follow-up for these patients. © 2011 The Authors.

T1  - Underuse of diagnostic possibilities in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinomas
AB  - At an early stage thyroid carcinomas are often asymptomatic and are therefore mostly detected by a standardized diagnostic approach to thyroid nodules. The aim of this study was to examine which diagnostic tools were applied, finally leading to the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. We retrospectively screened the charts of 256 patients with a history of differentiated thyroid carcinoma at the Leipzig University Hospital. Missing data were retrieved from referring physicians and the patients were interviewed in a standardized manner. Preexisting thyroid diseases like goiter or thyroid nodules were present in 23% and 27%. Palpable nodules or nodule growth were noted by 37% and 15% of the patients. Nodules with diameter of more than 3 cm were noticed significantly more frequent than smaller ones. As a diagnostic procedure thyroid scintigraphy was performed most often in 78,5%. The scintigraphic appearance of carcinomas >10mm was isocaptant in 28%, warm in 2% and cold in 70%. Ultrasound results were available for 251 patients. No comment on the echogenicity was found in 54%, hypoechogenicity in 32% hyperechogenicity in 2%, echocomplexity in 8%, isodensity in 2% and cysts in 2%. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed for sonographically >10 mm nodules in 10%. It was non diagnostic in 26%, benign in 15% and malignant in 59%. Patients with a malignant FNAC underwent primary thyroidectomy significantly more often (65%) than patients without(50%). Only 16% of the patients were operated because of a preoperative suspicion of malignancy. Our data demonstrate that most patients later diagnosed with a thyroid carcinoma underwent primary thyroid surgery without a specific suspicion of malignancy. This could most likely mainly be due to the very infrequent use of preoperative FNAC, a high rate of non diagnostic FNACs and a lack of malignancy risk stratification by ultrasound criteria.

T1  - Trends in the incidence of differentiated thyroid cancer over a period of 15 years in a single portuguese institution (1996-2010)
AB  - Background: In the last few years it has been reported, both in Europe and North America an increased incidence of differentiated thyroid cancer, mainly due to small papillary thyroid carcinoma.Aims: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between rates of detection, tumour size, age and sex of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer at a large universitary hospital in the north of Portugal during a period of 15 years (1996-2010)Methods: We evaluated retrospectively the pathology reports of all patients with a definitive diagnosis of thyroid cancer submitted to thyroid surgery in our institution during the last fifteen years. Tumours were classified by size, according to TNM classification 7<sup>th</sup> edition. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS 18.0 for Windows. Results: During this period a total of 1885 patients had a pathological diagnosis of thyroid cancer, 1614 women and 271 men with a mean age of 49,9+/-14,5 and 51,9+/-15,2 years old, respectively. The tumour size was <=1cm in 870 (44,8%), 1-2 cm in 553 (28,5%), 2-4 cm in 362 (18,6%), > 4 cm in 157 (8,1%) and unknown in 3 cases. Age at diagnosis was <= 45 years in 691 (36,7%) and > 45 years in 1194 (63,3%) patients. As expected the number of cases increased over this period of time. The proportion of small tumours (<= 2cm) increased from 46% in 1996 to 74,1% in 2010 (p=0,039). When we examined differences in tumour detection rate by age at diagnosis and sex we found a significant increase in the number of tumours detected in patients older than 45 years (50,9% in 1996 vs 71,4% in 2010). Conclusions: Our findings suggest an increased detection rate of small, subclinical tumours, which in turns probably reflects the widespread use of diagnostic imaging and greater detection of small, nonpalpable thyroid nodules.

T1  - Increased incidence of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma with decreased tumor size of thyroid cancer
AB  - The prevalence of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) in thyroid cancer varies from 20.0% to 42.8% with a mean of 30.0%. Most of these patients have benign clinical courses and receive less aggressive therapeutic procedures in most medical centers. This study retrospectively reviewed 30 years data in one institute and compared it with recent publications to illustrate change in trends and influence of PTMC. Incidental PTMC is usually diagnosed as a postoperative microcarcinoma following thyroidectomy for presumably benign thyroid lesions. Subtotal thyroidectomy or lobectomy without radioactive iodide treatment is sufficient to treat incidental PTMC. In contrast, aggressive surgical treatment with p<sup>131</sup>I therapy is indicated for non-incidental PTMC. Those with PTMC in the absence of extra-thyroid invasion diagnosed by postoperative permanent section received follow-up if they had initially received subtotal thyroidectomy. In long-term follow-up studies, cancer-specific mortality for PTMC ranged from 0% to 4%. Most of the mortality cases had distant metastasis at the time of surgery. The clinical course and therapeutic strategies for the non-incidental PTMC patients depend on the TNM stage at the time of diagnosis. One-third of PTMC with clinically aggressive behavior cannot be treated as indolent disease. Invasive tumor markers or larger tumor size are useful to predict tumor recurrence or distant metastasis for PTMC. © 2009 Humana Press Inc.

T1  - Increasing prevalence of papillary thyroid carcinoma in recent years in greece: The majority are incidental
AB  - Background: New cases of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) are diagnosed more frequently worldwide. We investigated trends and differences in clinical and histological characteristics of new DTC cases presenting in one large center. Methods: During the last 34 years 852 follicular cell-derived DTC cases (83% papillary [PTC], 17% follicular [FTC] carcinoma) presented in the Endocrine Unit of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics in Alexandra Hospital (18.8% men, mean age 42.4+/-14.5 years). Patients were classified in three period groups according to year of diagnosis: period 1, 1963-1982; period 2, 1983-1992; and period 3, 1993-2007. We recorded the histological type, age at diagnosis, and, in period 3, the type of pre-existing thyroid disease, the stage, and tumor size. Results: During periods 1, 2, and 3, the mean age at diagnosis was 37.7+/-12.3, 42.4+/-14.53, and 44.1+/-14.9 years (p=0.001), respectively, and the male to female ratio was similar. The prevalence of FTC was 22.7%, 28.1%, and 6.5%, respectively. In period 3, 51.6% of the PTCs were microcarcinomas (microPTC) <=10mm; these patients tended to be older (p=0.09). Microcarcinomas were more frequent among patients operated for pre-existing multinodular goiter (MNG) or prominent hot nodule compared to pre-existing single cold nodule (p<0.001, Pearson chi<sup>2</sup>). In period 3, 88% of the microPTC diagnoses were incidental. Of the incidental microPTCs detected in MNG, 25% had capsular invasion, 4.5% had lymph node involvement, and 3.6% had soft tissue involvement. Conclusions: We hypothesize that the prevalence of FTC during the last decade in our center in Greece was very low due to correction of iodine deficiency and a relative increase in the prevalence of microPTC. More than 50% of PTC diagnosed during the last decade were microPTCs that were detected incidentally in older persons with preexisting MNG or a prominent hot nodule. This is one of the highest, if not the highest percentage of microPTCs that were incidentally detected. Despite many of these having features of invasiveness, most appear to remain clinically silent. Research is needed to identify factors predisposing microPTCs to evolve from a subclinical to a clinically apparent form. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

T1  - Pathways to the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in New South Wales
AB  - Background: Increases in the incidence of thyroid cancer have been observed over the last few decades in many countries, particularly in developed countries. This study investigated whether there have been increases in, and changes to, diagnostic and treatment modalities which contribute to the increased incidence. Methods: Newly diagnosed cases of thyroid cancer were identified and recruited by the population-based NSW Central Cancer Registry. Participants completed a paper-based questionnaire and diary of doctor visits and investigations that led to their diagnosis. Detailed information was extracted from pathology reports and participants consented to their diagnostic and treatment data being obtained from Medicare Australia. Results: 452 people with thyroid cancer completed the study. The median age at diagnosis was 48 for women and 53 years for men and 76% were female. Almost half of participants had tumours <=1 cm and tumour size was significantly larger in men. Only 40% of diagnoses occurred after the patient reported a lump or symptom. The remainder were detected by the doctor noticing a lump (16%), as an incidental finding of radiography for other conditions (11%), through further investigation of a benign disorder (26%) or by other mechanisms (7%). The diagnostic pathways differed significantly for men and women with a larger proportion of men having a lump detected by the doctor or incidental radiographical findings. Over 60% of the thyroid cancers were diagnosed from pathology after surgery. 62% of the thyroid cancers found by further investigation of a benign disorder were microcarcinomas (<=1 cm) compared with 40% of those patient detected, 47% of those found by the doctor and 25% of those incidentally detected through radiography. Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that only 40% of thyroid cancers are diagnosed after patient initiated investigations. This may be a factor in the observed increase in thyroid cancer incidence.

T1  - Prevalence of thyroid cancer at a medical screening center: Pathological features of screen-detected thyroid carcinomas
AB  - Purpose: To assess the incidence of thyroid malignancy in an adult population screened by high-resolution ultrasonography at a medical screening center and to compare the clinical and pathological features of screen-detected thyroid carcinomas to symptomatic overt thyroid carcinomas. Materials and Methods: We calculated the prevalence of screen-detected thyroid cancer at a medical screening center using high-resolution ultrasonography and fine needle aspiration. We then compared the clinical and pathological features of screen-detected thyroid cancers (n = 46) to clinical symptomatic thyroid cancers (n = 157). We evaluated age, gender, size, perithyroidal extension, lymphovascular extension, stage, histological lymph node metastasis, and the type of cancer. We also compared the above findings of micropapillary carcinomas to papillary thyroid carcinomas that were larger than 1 cm in diameter. Results: Screen-detected thyroid nodule patients were 2,747 (37%) of 7,491 patients. Nodules selected for fine needle aspiration were 658 and cytology confirmed malignancy were 79 (12%) nodules. When screen-detected thyroid cancers (n = 46) were compared to symptomatic overt thyroid cancers (n = 157), only statistically significant factor was size (p = 0.002). Papillary thyroid carcinomas that were larger than 1 cm had more frequent capsular invasion (p = 0.000) and a higher stage (p = 0.027), and a higher prevalence of lymph node metastases (p = 0.002). Conclusion: Screen-detected thyroid cancers should be managed as same as symptomatic thyroid cancers in respect to size, and an assessment should strictly be based on the ultrasound features and fine needle aspiration biopsy findings.

T1  - Diagnosis and treatment of thyroid microcarcinoma. [Chinese]
AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatment of thyroid microcarcinoma (TMC). Methods: The morbility, clinical and pathological characteristics, pre-operative and intraoperative diagnoses and treatments of 51 patients with TMC were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The sum of TMC occupied 29.0% of all the thyroid carcinomas within the same period, and 19.6% tumors were multiple and manifestated nodular mass clinically. Fifteen cases were found node in thyroid by screening, and 45 cases (88.2%) were indicated as doubtful thyroid carcinoma by pre-operative B ultrasonography. All the cases were examinated routinely by the frozen section method in operation, and the main operation type was total resection of lobe, isthmus and subtotal resection of contralateral lobe. IV, VI, III lymphonodes were explored and detected by the frozen section, and radical neck dissection was performed on 16 cases with lymphonods metastasis, and 37.3% TMC with lymphatic metastasis was proved by pathology, 74.5% cases were accompanied with nodular goiter and 27.5% with Hashimotos thyroiditis, 4 cases with thyroid carcinoma only. All patients were followed up from 2 to 74 months, and well alive without tumor. Conclusions: TMC has high morbility and accompanies common benign thyroid nodular mass, and most patients with TMC have good prognoses. Those methods of preoperative ultrasonography, thorough exploration and frozen section during operation help to diagnose TMC, and pertinent operation type can eliminate tumors and avoid unnecessary excess treatment.

T1  - Clinical study of neoplastic thyroid swellings with particular reference to surgical management
AB  - The prospective study of 108 patients of thyroid malignancy were studied with regard to surgical management in SKIMS, Srinagar. Thyroid malignancy constituted 0.12% of total hospital admissions. It was seen mainly in patients belonging to rural areas (66.67%). The commonest observed thyroid malignancy was papillary carcinoma (48.15%), followed by follicular carcinoma (37.04%), anaplastic carcinoma (7.41%), medullary carcinoma (5.55%) and malignant lymphoma (1.85%). Females were affected more commonly with a female to male ration of 3.1:1. Patients ranged in age from 8 years to 70 years. Maximum number of cases with papillary carcinoma (34.62%), follicular carcinoma (40%) and anaplastic carcinoma (66.67%) presented in 4th, 5th and 6th decades of life respectively with a mean age of 34.85 years, 42.40 years and 61.25 years for papillary, follicular and anaplastic carcinoma respectively. Swelling in front of neck was the most common (96.29%) presenting symptom, followed by hoarseness of voice. The majority of patients were having hard swellings with nodular surfaces and the swelling were free. No patient had retrosternal extension of thyroid swelling. 18.51% of patients had clinically palpable lymph nodes. Fine needle aspiration cytology was an important adjuvant to pre-operative diagnosis having sensitivity of 92.59% and specificity of 100%. Thyroid scan detected cold nodule/nodules in maximum number (90.74%) of patients. Indirect laryngoscopy detected vocal cord palsy in 14.81% patients pre-operatively. Total thyroidectomy was performed in maximum (83.33%) number of patients followed by near total thyroidectomy. The main post-operative complications were hypoparathyroidism (12.96%) and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (11.11 %). Anaplastic carcinoma was found a rapidly growing tumour, with a limited surgical scope.

T1  - Prevalence and clinical data of thyroid microcarcinoma (TMC)
AB  - Introduction: Thyroid microcarcinoma (TMC) is defined by WHO as carcinoma 1 cm or less in greatest dimension. The incidence increase in the last years and its prognosis are good; however, locoregional recurrence has been reported in 0-11% of TMC patients, and rare cases of distant metastases and death have also been reported. Objective: To determine the prevalence of TMC and surgery cause, prognosis factor associated, and recurrence. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data in 176 patients with cancer-differentiated thyroid (CDT) diagnosis from December 1986 to December 2006. We analyzed sex, age, surgery cause, tumoral size, multifocality, bilaterality, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node, and distant metastases, hyperthyroidism association and evolution. The follow-up was from 6 months to 20 years. Results: 21.6% (n = 38) were TMC, 79% were women (n = 30), 64% were >45 years old. The surgery causes were positive cytology in 12 patients (31.6%), primary hyperparathyroidism in 1 patient, mediastinal metastases of CDT in 1 patient, hyperthyroidism in 5 patients (13%), and multinodular goiter in 19 patients (50%). 26.3% (n = 10) were multifocal, 18.4% (n = 7) bilateral. 15.8% (n = 6) had positive lymph node at diagnosis moment and 13% (n = 5) had capsule extension. 9 out of 38 patients with TMC were associated with hyperthyroidism (6 Grave's disease and 3 Plummer's disease). At the moment, 37 patients are free of disease, one patient presents neck lymph node metastases, and nobody die for TMC. Conclusion: Our prevalence and surgery cause were the same than reported. In our experience there were not serious complications. At the moment we continue screening and follow-up of our patients because of the interesting results obtained.

T1  - Clinical and histological characteristics of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma: Results of a retrospective study in 243 patients
AB  - Context: The recognition of thyroid microcarcinoma has increased due to the widespread use of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsies. Objective: The objective of this study was to describe histological and clinical characteristics of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) less than or equal to 1 cm. Design: This study was a retrospective cohort. Setting: This study was conducted at a university hospital endocrine clinic. Patients: Over a 9-yr period, 243 consecutive patients with PTMC were studied. Results: PTMC was an incidental finding at surgery in 21.4% of the PTMC cases. There were no differences in the clinical characteristics between those with incidental PTMC and those with suspected thyroid carcinoma. None of the patients with a cancer less than 8mmhad distant metastases, whereas distant metastases were observed in patients with cancers >= 8 mm (P <= 0.05). Disease-related mortality was not observed. Conclusions: PTMC is prevalent in the population. Among patients with PTMC, tumor size more than 8 mm is associated with more aggressive disease.

T1  - Cancer incidence in the South Asian population of California, 1988-2000
AB  - Background: Although South Asians (SA) form a large majority of the Asian population of U.S., very little is known about cancer in this immigrant population. SAs comprise people having origins mainly in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. We calculated age-adjusted incidence and time trends of cancer in the SA population of California (state with the largest concentration of SAs) between 1988-2000 and compared these rates to rates in native Asian Indians as well as to those experienced by the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and White, non-Hispanic population (NHW) population of California. Methods: Age adjusted incidence rates observed among the SA population of California during the time period 1988-2000 were calculated. To correctly identify the ethnicity of cancer cases, 'Nam Pehchan' (British developed software) was used to identify numerator cases of SA origin from the population-based cancer registry in California (CCR). Denominators were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau. Incidence rates in SAs were calculated and a time trend analysis was also performed. Comparison data on the API and the NHW population of California were also obtained from CCR and rates from Globocan 2002 were used to determine rates in India. Results: Between 1988-2000, 5192 cancers were diagnosed in SAs of California. Compared to rates in native Asian Indians, rates of cancer in SAs in California were higher for all sites except oropharyngeal, oesophageal and cervical cancers. Compared to APIs of California, SA population experienced more cancers of oesophagus, gall bladder, prostate, breast, ovary and uterus, as well as lymphomas, leukemias and multiple myelomas. Compared to NHW population of California, SAs experienced more cancers of the stomach, liver and bile duct, gall bladder, cervix and multiple myelomas. Significantly increasing time trends were observed in colon and breast cancer incidence. Conclusions: SA population of California experiences unique patterns of cancer incidence most likely associated with acculturation, screening and tobacco habits. There is need for early diagnosis of leading cancers in SA. If necessary steps are not taken to curb the growth of breast, colon and lung cancer, rates in SA will soon approximate those of the NHW population of California. © 2005 Jain et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - Thyroid papillary cancers: Microcarcinoma and carcinoma, incidental cancers and non-incidental cancers - Are they different diseases?
AB  - Objective: Tumour size represents a much-debated prognostic factor in papillary cancer, and the necessity to perform a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) on small nodules is a frequent matter of discussion. We compared some prognostic histological features for various sizes of papillary cancers (PCs) and, with regard to these prognostic features, we compared non-incidental with incidental PCs. We also considered the possibility that ultrasonography could detect nodules harbouring the most aggressive cancers. Design and patients: We have studied patients with a histological diagnosis of PC from 1999 to 2003. FNA was performed on all nodules > 1.0 cm and on hypoechoic nodules with irregular margins or microcalcification when the size was < 1.0 cm (3321 FNAs in total). We were able to consider several different types of patients: those with PC diagnosed by FNA before surgery; those with large goitre and PC of small size diagnosed after histological examination and in whom a careful examination of the presurgical ultrasonography could show a distinct highly suspicious nodule that was not subjected to FNA, and patients with real incidental PC (that is, those with nodular goitre who correctly underwent FNA on suspicious nodules but in whom thyroid cancer was discovered only at histological examination). We considered two groups of patients with PC. Group 1 PCs were diagnosed before surgery with FNA (128 cases); in this group we also considered the two cases that were not correctly diagnosed before surgery. Group 2 real incidental PCs (12 cases) were found in goitres at histological examination after thyroidectomy for goitre (282 thyroidectomies). Group 1 was divided into three subgroups according to the maximum size of the PC at histological examination: (a) 44 PCs with maximum size < 10 mm, (b) 47 PCs with maximum size between 10 mm and 20 mm, and (c) 39 PCs with maximum size >= 20 mm. In all subgroups 1 as well as in group 2, the following four histological features were considered separately: multifocality, extracapsular extension, lymph-node involvement and its extent, and special aggressive features (dedifferentiation and/or insular aspects, tall and columnar variants). Results: In subgroups 1a, 1b and 1c the results were, respectively: multifocality 56.8, 57.4 and 51.2%; extracapsular extension 27.2, 23.4 and 46.3% (P = 0.01, subgroups 1a and 1b vs. subgroup 1c); lymph-node metastasis 13.5, 23.3 and 46.1% (P = 0.003 subgroup 1a vs. 1c; P = 0.04, subgroup 1b vs. 1c); special aggressive features 11.3, 25.5 and 28.2% (P = ns). Group 2 showed one case of multifocality (8.3%) in a patient with prior exposure to radiotherapy in childhood, while no case was found of extracapsular invasion or lymph-node involvement, and only one patient had a PC with features of dedifferentiation. Conclusions: Non-incidental cancer, apart from multifocality, showed a classical progression for all prognostic factors from microcarcinoma to larger cancers. However, real incidental PC seemed to be different from non-incidental PC microcarcinoma regarding the main prognostic features. We conclude that ultrasonography is useful not only in terms of revealing the presence of cancer but also in identifying the most aggressive cancers. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

T1  - Personal experience about papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid gland. [French]
AB  - Introduction: papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) of the thyroid gland is high incidence pathology. Most of cases are related to a good prognosis. Conversely, numerous cases are reported with an aggressive course. Prognosis factors are age, size of tumour, multifocality, capsular invasion and cervical lymphadenopathy. Material and method: we have conduced a retrospective study about 4 208 consecutive thyroidectomies over a period of 16 years. 251 cases of papillary cancers were analysed including 64 PMC (25,5 %). Results: 90 % of PMC were incidentally found and 59% were diagnosed during surgical procedure. Multifocality improved the sensibility of histological diagnosis (P=0.04). In 78 %, total thyroidectomy was performed associated with a selective neck dissection in 47 %. In case of extemporaneous diagnosis all partial thyroidectomy was convert into total thyroidectomy. In case of delayed diagnosis and in the absence of unfavourable prognosis factor, no other surgical procedure was carried out. A 7 years mean follow-up revealed only one case of recurrence successfully treated with Iodine 131 ablation. There was no case of death due to PMC. Conclusion: this study confirms the good prognosis of PMC treated according to usual criterions.

T1  - Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma in Martinique. [French]
AB  - The thyroid neoplasm is easely entered in the accounts in Martinique with the Tumor Registry created in 1981. This is not a frequent cancer but its frequency grew since 1981 till 1995. The treatment of the well differentiated thyroid cancer is well standardized with a total thyroidectomy generally followed by a metabolic thyroidectomy with 1311. The follow-up is composed by clinical exam, TSH and thyroglobulin measurements. The results are very good and we mean to continue this strategy refining it for the little papillary tumors and using the recombinant TSH. The Tchernobyl event in 1986 generated new epidemiological considerations and has been the object of multiples studies. The studies realized in such a very distant site like Martinique permitted the realization of comparisons with the Tumor Registry of the "Bas Rhin" in France a geographical area that could have been concerned by the disaster. The result of this study finds a growth of the incidence of the thyroid neoplasm almost identical with that registered in the mainland with a net increase for the papillary neoplasms. We may then conclude that the growth percentage since 1981 till 1995 due to the availability and more frequent using of many new diagnostic means less operator-dependent than before. By this descriptive study we may purport that the incidence of the thyroid cancer is low (4,45 per 100 000 population for women and 0,9 per 100 000 population for men). Treatment is consensual and thanks to the lifelong administration of exogenous thyroid hormone the quality of life of these patients is maintained along with a sure recovery in most of the cases. The mortality due to the thyroid cancer is very low in the orthoplasic form (less than 1% of all types of cancer). The precocious screening of the thyroid neoplasm has to enter then in the guidelines in medical education. It consists in the systematical exploring of a thyroid nodule by clinical exam and by ultrasonography, radioisotope scanning with Tc-99m pertechnetate and by fine-needle aspiration if a well-trained thyroid cytopathologist is available. The aim is to find a compromise between an easyto-live follow up and the inopportune removal of the thyroid nodules.

T1  - A rational approach to the diagnosis of thyroid cancer: A retrospective study on 41951 patients
AB  - Nodular thyroid disease is a frequent occurrence in everyday clinical practice. The several diagnostic procedures currently available allow a precise definition of the morphological, pathological and functional characteristics of the thyroid nodules but, if not used rationally, may lead to an unjustified increase in costs with little practical gain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of a rational approach to the diagnosis of thyroid cancer, based on fine needle aspiration (FNA) of palpable thyroid nodules, after functional evaluation by thyroid scintigraphy. Methods: 41951 FNAs performed in the period 1980-1999 were retrospectively evaluated. FNAs had been performed on palpable thyroid nodules, except unambiguously autonomous ("hot") nodules at thyroid scintigraphy. Cytological and histological diagnoses were compared in 4462 patients, to estimate the accuracy of FNA. Results: The sensitivity of FNA was 92.6% and specificity 76.2 %. A pre-test probability of thyroid cancer of 4% was reduced to 0.33% in the patients with a cytological diagnosis of benign nodular goiter, while it was increased to 90.78% in the patients with a positive cytological diagnosis. Only in the case of a cytological diagnosis of "follicular neoplasm" was the probability of cancer not changed significantly and histological evaluation of the nodule was necessary. Conclusions: FNA of palpable thyroid nodules allows to identify thyroid cancers and to plan the subsequent appropriate therapy in most cases. This can be achieved by using simple and inexpensive procedures, if cooperation amongst clinician, pathologist and nuclear physician is maximized.

T1  - Clinical experience in the diagnosis of 127 papillary thyroid microcarcinomas
AB  - To investigate the difficulties in the diagnosis of thyroid microcarcinoma and to present the results of delaying diagnosis for these patients, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical information of 1259 thyroid carcinoma patients in one medical center. During a period of 20 years, from January 1977 to June 1997, 1259 thyroid cancer patients, including 921 papillary thyroid carcinoma patients, who received treatment and were followed-up at Chang Gung Medical Center in Linkou, Taiwan, were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Of these patients, 127 (13.2%) were diagnosed as having thyroid microcarcinoma. Forty-five patients were diagnosed as malignancy or suspicious malignancy preoperatively with ultrasonography and fine needle aspiration cytological examinations. In the analysis, the 127 thyroid microcarcinoma patients who received surgical treatment could be divided into four groups. Group I: patients with thyroid microcarcinoma with hyperthyroidism or hyperparathyroidism, in most of whom (except four patients) the thyroid microcarcinoma was found incidentally during the operation (28 cases). Group II: thyroid microcarcinoma in benign larger thyroid nodule or multinodular goiter, or thyroid microcarcinoma in coexistence with nodule goiter in one patient. The thyroid microcarcinomas in this group were found incidentally except in five patients (58 cases). Group III: thyroid microcarcinoma which could be detected as thyroid nodule preoperatively (28 cases). Group IV: thyroid microcarcinoma presented with neck lymph node metastases or distant metastases of the thyroid carcinoma (13 cases). Median follow-up period of these 127 patients was 4.7 years. During the follow-up period, two patients died, including one patient in group IV who died of skull metastasis with brain invasion. Another patient died of stroke, which was, however, not related to thyroid carcinoma. In conclusion, most thyroid microcarcinoma patients experienced rather benign clinical courses, but for patients with thyroid microcarcinoma with distant metastases, aggressive surgical treatment followed by radioactive <sup>131</sup>I treatment is indicated.

T1  - Clinico-pathological evaluation of thyroid microcarcinoma. [Italian]
AB  - We have analysed the results of surgical treatment for microcarcinoma of the thyroid (MCT). In sixteen patient clinical and follow-up data were retrospectively evaluated during a 35.1 - month follow-up. Thyroid hyperfunctional state us was present in two subyects. A single nodule was detected by echotomography in 11 patients, while multi-nodular diffuse goitre was revealed in 3 patients. In the last two subjects, thyroid gland appeared completely normal at ultrasonography, despite laterocervical lymphnodal metastases. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed in 6 patients and its diagnostic accuracy was high (83, 3%). MCT was classified as 'incidental' in 12 patients and 'occult' in the remaining 4 patients. Eight subjects underwent total thyroidectomy and 8 emithyroidectomy plus isthmectomy. No postoperative complications were recorded. In 10 patients MCT histotype was papillar adenocarcinoma, in 5 was follicular adenocarcinoma and in the remaining case it was medullary carcinoma. Goitre was associated in 75% of the cases. Only in a patient disease progressed to death because of hematogenous metastases. In conclusion, we believe that incidental MCT is a low-grade malignancy with a benign biological behaviour. Occult MCT is a potentially lethal disease. We did not observe differences in the long-term results between different surgical treatments of MCT.

T1  - Occult papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Retrospective study. [French]
AB  - From 1.5.1986 to 1.11.1994, 2975 patients underwent 3015 cervical explorations. There were 244 thyroid cancers, among them 58 (23.7%) revealed an occult papillary carcinoma (inferior to 5 mm size). Surgical indication was based on a palpable thyroid nodule in 23 patients, a goitre in 29 patients, a secondary hyperparathyroidism in 2 patients, a cervical lymph node in 3 patients and a cancer of the oesophagus in 1 patient. Only 45% of these cancers were revealed by peroperative frozen sections. In 32 patients (55%) diagnosis was attained after fixation and section of paraffin block. Nine patients underwent therefore a second cervical exploration to extend the thyroidectomy; in 5 patients, a single lobectomy was performed. There were 52 papillary carcinomas and 6 follicular variants of papillary cancers. Thirteen of them (22.4%) were invasive tumours with capsular invasion, vascular or lymphatic involvement. Five patients (8.6%) had lymph node involvement and 1 patient a pulmonary metastasis. Twelve of the 53 patients with total thyroidectomy (22.6%) presented multifocal lesions including 7 patients (12%) with bilateral carcinoma. Although 1 patient died of septic shock, three months after the oesophagectomy for cancer, occult papillary carcinomas of the thyroid have a good prognosis. Nevertheless, multifocality, bilaterality, invasiveness and lymph node involvement are consistent factors which the AA consider require a total thyroidectomy.

T1  - Diagnosis and surgical treatment of small papillary carcinomas of the thyroid gland
AB  - The preoperative and pathological findings of 38 cases of small papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland measuring <=10 mm in diameter and 74 cases of large papillary carcinoma measuring more than 10 mm were compared. In the small carcinoma cases, the sensitivity of palpation, ultrasonography, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was higher than that of computed tomography and soft tissue roentgenography of the neck. Therefore, palpation, US, and FNAB should be instituted as reliable diagnostic methods, but other examinations seem unsuitable as methods for preoperative qualitative diagnosis. No definite correlation was found between the intraglandular dissemination and the size of the carcinoma, and the frequency of metastasis was relatively high even in the small carcinoma cases. If the patient elects to undergo surgery, subtotal thyroidectomy with lymph node dissection should be performed for small thyroid carcinomas as well as large carcinomas.

T1  - Analysis of thyroid carcinoma based on material registered in Japan during 1977-1986 with special reference to predominance of papillary type
AB  - Background. As geographic differences have been observed in the characteristics of thyroid carcinoma, an analysis was made on thyroid carcinoma in the iodine rich country of Japan. Methods. A total of 10,973 patients with histologically confirmed thyroid carcinoma registered in Japan from 1977-1986 were analyzed. Cases detected incidentally at autopsy and cases of nonepithelial tumor were excluded. This series included approximately 27% of all thyroid carcinoma cases in Japan. Results and Conclusions. Histologic distribution showed that papillary carcinoma accounted for 78.4% of cases, follicular carcinoma accounted for 17.2%, medullary carcinoma for 1.4%, squamous cell carcinoma for 0.3%, and anaplastic carcinoma for 2.7%. There is a tendency in Japan to diagnose papillary carcinoma as follicular carcinoma and to diagnose malignant lymphoma as anaplastic carcinoma. It was considered that the percentage of papillary carcinoma was higher and the percentage of follicular carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma was lower than foregoing values. The characteristics of thyroid carcinoma in Japan were described, and the low incidence of nonpapillary carcinoma compared with papillary carcinoma was discussed in relation to iodine excess as an etiologic factor.

T1  - Thyroid carcinoma: Results from surgical treatment in 211 consecutive patients
AB  - A retrospective study was undertaken of 211 patients who were operated on for thyroid carcinoma. The revised histological diagnoses were papillary (n = 167), follicular (n = 26), medullary (n = 9) and undifferentiated (n = 9). No patient was lost to follow up (mean 10 years). In 162 patients a palpable neck mass was the only clinical presentation of disease (76 %). Fine needle aspiration cytology was increasingly used throughout the period. Total thyroidectomy was done in 167 (79 %), hemi or subtotal thyroidectomy in 22 (10 %), the remaining received palliative treatment. Accidental unilateral vocal cord paralysis occurred in 3 (1.4 %). Total thyroidectomy was followed by permanent hypoparathyroidism in 19 (11 %). The tumour recurred in 37 (19 %), and 23 of the patients died of thyroid cancer (11 %). The disease specific mortality for patients with undifferentiated tumours was 77 % compared with 8 % for patients with differentiated tumours. In the latter group, death of cancer was correlated significantly with age, sex, tumour size, presence of regional metastases, and palliative treatment.

T1  - Preoperative diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer and lymph node metastasis risk evaluation using clinical information-based bioinformatics models
AB  - Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common histologic type of thyroid carcinoma and is associated with a high risk of cervical regional lymph node metastasis (LNM). In this study, we evaluated the utility of clinical features combined with ultrasound (US) characteristics in both PTC diagnosis and LNM models for surgical decision-making. Clinical data including demographics, physical examination records, sonographic features and multifocality were recorded in 1,265 patients from two centers. PTC diagnosis and LNM prediction models was developed using four data mining methods: binary logistic regression, artificial neural networks, naïve Bayes and a random forest classifier to select the optimal algorithms. Prediction performance was compared by sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Application of eight clinical descriptors-age, tumor discovery time (time from first presentation of thyroid nodule determined by US to surgical treatment), texture of mass palpation, nodule US features as maximum diameter, cystic lesion, echo type, irregular morphology and calcification-in a thyroid carcinoma diagnosis model achieved 80.1% sensitivity, 83.7% specificity, 81.4% PPV, 82.5% NPV, 0.894 AUC and 82.0% accuracy. Application of LNM status, age, hormone levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), mobility of mass palpation, multifocality and damaged lymph node structure in US for the classifier prediction achieved 42.2% sensitivity, 86.0% specificity, 56.9% PPV, 71.0% NPV, 0.710 AUC and 70.2% accuracy. Clinical information-based classifiers performed well in PTC prediction but poorly in the identification of LNM status. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

T1  - Differentiated thyroid cancer: Diagnostic guidelines and management
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, prevalence, morbidity and mortality related to surgical treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in the population who was attended to our service. Materials and methods: A retrospective study of 284 medical records of patients assisted at the service between 1987-2007, with a pathological diagnosis of CDT. For the calculation of survival used Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The average age of diagnosis was 43.54 years and the most frequent presentation was palpable nodule, with an average of 1.3 palpable cervical nodes. There was a follow up of 93% with an average of 9 years (9 months-18 years). There was no mortality related to surgical procedure (up to 30 days after surgery), while overall survival at 5, 10 and 20 years was 97, 92 and 87% respectively. Postoperative morbidity was related to definitive paralysis of recurrent nerve in 8 patients (2.8%) and permanent hypoparathyroidism in 6 patients (2.11%). Conclusions: The prevalence of differentiated thyroid cancer in our hospital was 0.59%. The overall rate of long-term complications was 8.2% (8 recurrent paralysis and 6 HPP). We recommend total thyroidectomy as a gold standard treatment for the DTC, which allows us to control radical pathology and improved postoperative follow-up with an acceptable risk-benefit ratio.

T1  - Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma - Own experience
AB  - ding to the WHO classification, is applied to papillary tumors no larger than 1.0 cm in diameter, which are incidentally detected during the postoperative histopathological examination. In clinical practice, the term pertains to all papillary tumors of the size smaller than or equal to 1 cm. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma and its selected histopathological characteristics among patients with malignant cancer of the thyroid gland identified in our own material in the years 2000-2007. Material and methods. The study included 523 patients treated for thyroid carcinoma: 401 (76.7%) women and 122 (23.3%) men aged 12-83 years (mean 49.8 years). Surgeries were carried out according to the Polish Group for Endocrine Carcinomas recommendations, in compliance with the European consensus. Results. Papillary thyroid carcinoma was identified in the postoperative histopathological examination in 391 (74.8%) patients; 285 (72.9%) women and 106 (27.1%) men. Their age ranged from 14 to 75 years (mean 49.3 years). Among 391 cases, tumor progression classified according to the WHO criteria (3) was as follows: Tl in 260 (66.5%), T2 in 59 (15.1%), T3 in 53 (13.5%) and T4 in 19 (4.8%) patients. In 150 cases (38.4% of papillary tumors), the tumor fulfilled the morphological criteria for microcarcinoma (4) and was detected in 118 (78.7%) women and 32 (21.3%) men. Carcinoma was identified in the neutral goiter in 138 cases, and in 12 patients in hyperactive, including 9 in nodular and 3 in Graves' goiters. The disease was suspected or diagnosed preoperatively or at surgery in 112 patients. Postoperative diagnosis was performed in 38 (25.3%) individuals with micrcarcinoma. Twenty-four (38%) of 63 patients with multifocal tumors were subjected to adjunctive surgery as their cancer diagnosis was made only postoperatively in the histopathological examination. The subcapsular location of microcarcinoma was found in 78 (49.4%) cases including capsular infiltration and extracapsular invasion in 14 patients. The exact histopathological examination showed multifocality in 63 (42%) cases and involvement of the local lymph nodes in 29 (19.3%) patients. In 21 cases, the central compartment lymph nodes were involved. The presence of metastases in the central and lateral lymph node compartment was observed in 5 cases; in 3 patients skip metastases were detected in the lateral compartment on the tumor side omitting the central compartment. No patient with microcarcinoma diagnosed between the years 2000 and 2007 revealed distant metastases. Conclusions. Due to contemporary diagnostics, papillary thyroid microcarcinomas - tumors up to 1 cm - are most commonly identified cancers of the thyroid gland. High accuracy of US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of high resolution permits to diagnose the majority of these tumors prior to surgery.

T1  - Asymptomatic thyroid carcinoma diagnosed at our clinic for the past 10 years
AB  - Although the main symptoms of the malignant thyroid tumor are anterior neck mass, hoarseness or difficulty in swallowing, considerable number of the cases does not complain of any symptom relating to the thyroid gland. In the present study, 232 cases without any thyroid gland related symptom were selected from cases who underwent the ultrasonographic examination for the past 10 years and their findings were retrospectively analysed. These cases were divided into two groups by history and physical examination, ie one was the cases without any thyroid symptom but a positive finding on palpation of the thyroid (group I) and the other was those complaining of foreign body sensation of the throat with the presence or absence of a positive palpation finding (group II). The ultrasonographic findings suggesting malignant tumors and benign lesions were 7.0% and 61.6% in group I, and 5.4% and 44.6% in group II, respectively. Although abnormal findings were less frequent in group II than in group I, similar results were obtained between group I and cases of group II with a positive finding on palpation. The surgery was performed in 9 cases of group I and 10 cases of group II, and the pathological diagnosis was papillary carcinoma in 5 and 6 cases in group I and II, respectively. Nowadays, the ultrasonography is known to be very sensitive to detect the thyroid tumor. The present results strongly indicate the extreme importance of a palpation finding to select the cases for ultrasonography examination. © 1999, Society of Oto-rhino-laryngology Tokyo.

T1  - What should we prefer in the surgical management of differentiated thyroid carcinomas?
AB  - Aim: The study evaluates the results of surgical procedures performed in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. There are many discussions regarding the optimal surgical treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma; their focal point is the type or extent of thyroidectomy. Material and Method: We performed a retrospective analysis on 85 patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, treated in the period July 2007 - April 2017. The average age the patients, consisting of 15 males and 70 females, was of 41 (17-85) years. The gross findings at operation and the prognostic factors such as patients' age, tumour size, local invasion, nodal involvement and the presence of distant metastasis were taken into account when deciding on the type of thyroidectomy, and cervical neck dissection. Results: The most prominent symptom was the existence of a cervical mass (85%); fineneedle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed in 73 patients and revealed a diagnostic accuracy in 61 patients (72%). Histological examination confirmed papillary carcinoma in 76 patients, follicular carcinoma in 8 patients and medullary carcinoma in 1 patient. When the diagnosis was established, 19 patients had palpable neck lymph nodes, and 25 patients had a local invasion to surrounding structures. While total thyroidectomy was performed in 71 (83.5%) patients, 11 (12.4%) patients underwent lobectomy and subtotal thyroidectomy, and 3 (3.5%) patients underwent lobectomy and near-total lobectomy. Modified neck dissection was added to 13 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy. No operative mortality was observed, and the cancer-related mortality rate was 10.2%. Temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism rates were 5% and 1.1%, respectively. Temporary and permanent recurrent nerve paralysis was observed to be of 3% and 0%, respectively. Conclusion: The selection of treatment for differentiated thyroid carcinoma should be made based on risk factors. All procedures such as lobectomy + subtotal lobectomy, near-total thyroidectomy, and total thyroidectomy are selected in safe conditions. In addition to total thyroidectomy, modified neck dissection should also be considered for patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma with nodal involvement. © 2019 Celsius Publishing House.

T1  - A review of the propriety of thyroid ultrasound referrals and their follow-up burden
AB  - PURPOSE: The overdiagnosis of thyroid nodules and indolent thyroid cancers represents an increasing burden on health services, with thyroid ultrasound (US) imaging often representing the initial entry point into the thyroid nodule diagnostic pathway. The aim of this study was to retrospectively review thyroid US referrals to a single Irish hospital to determine if the stated indications for imaging had been appropriate, to review the results of the scans, and to assess the follow-up required in each case. METHODS: Patient demographics, scan indications, results, and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed for all patients undergoing thyroid ultrasound from 2012 to 2016. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism and expressed in mean +/- standard deviation. RESULTS: In total, 318 patients (mean age 53 +/- 15 years, 85% female) had at least one ultrasound. Most US scans were performed for appropriate indications in order to follow up known thyroid nodular disease and/or malignancy (34.3%), to assess new thyroid goiters or discrete neck lumps (33.3%), and to follow up incidental findings from other imaging modalities (12.6%). However, scans were also requested (in the absence of any palpable goiter or mass) for choking/neck pain/swallowing complaints (12.3%), hypo/hyperthyroidism (6.6%), and miscellaneous reasons (0.6%) that were deemed either potentially or likely inappropriate. Of these scans, approximately half of the identified nodule(s) were deemed unlikely to be related to the stated symptoms, but which subsequently required follow-up imaging +/- biopsy. No cases of malignancy were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In our center, a significant percentage of thyroid US scans along with their subsequent follow-up were potentially avoidable.

T1  - A cancer of undetermined significance: Incidental thyroid carcinoma
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing which can be attributed in part to improved ultrasonography (US) methods and increased detection of incidental thyroid carcinomas (ITC). We aimed to compare ITC with nonincidental thyroid carcinomas (NITC) in this study. METHODS: Retrospective analyses of 906 individual patients who were operated for benign and malignant thyroid disease and had a final histopathological diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma were enrolled in this study. Preoperative US examination and fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy results were evaluated. The tumor foci in thyroidectomy specimens that were not represented in preoperative US or FNA reports were classified as ITC. The tumor foci that match with the lesions defined in US or FNA results were classified as NITC. RESULTS: Final histology revealed ITC in 326 patients (36%) and NITC in 580 patients (64% Mean age was 51.7 +/- 11.11 in ITC group and 48.15 +/- 13.1 in NITC group (P < .001). In NITC group 322 (55.5%) of the patients were operated for suspicious cytology while only 29 (8.9%) of the patients in the ITC group were operated because of this indication (P < .001). There were 1301 cancer foci in histopathology specimens. Among all these cancer foci, 434 (33.3%) were detected incidentally and 867 (66.7%) were detected non-incidentally. About 779 (89.9%) of nonincidental cancer foci were papillary cancer (PTC), while all of the incidental cancer foci were PTC. Mean size was 13 mm in NITC group and it was 3 mm in the ITC group and differed significantly between the groups (P < .001). Tumor size was <=1 cm in 35.2% of the patients with NITC while 98.5% of patients with ITC had tumor <=1 cm. The occurrence of multinodularity was higher in ITC than the NITC group (P < 001). Median TSH level was higher in patients with NITC than ITC while both were in the reference range (1.53 vs 1.03 muIU/mL, P < .001). The frequency of thyroiditis detected by US, and thyroid peroxidase antibody and thyroglobulin antibody positivities were similar in patients with ITC and NITC (P = .2, P = .86, and P = .26, respectively). The frequencies of capsular invasion (29.1% vs 7.9%), extrathyroidal extension (13% vs 4.2%), multifocality (35.8% vs 24.2%), non-complete resection (9.2% vs 1.8%), and lymph node metastasis (9.5% vs 1.8%) were significantly higher in the NITC group (P < .001, for each). Persistent/recurrent disease in patients with NITC was more frequent than patients with ITC (P = .004). This outcome was similar for cancers measuring <=1 cm (P = .001). CONCLUSION: ITC is often encountered in older patients and frequently determined in early stages with more favorable histopathological features and better prognosis.

T1  - Incidental thyroid papillary microcarcinoma: survival and follow-up
AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: The aim was to study the survival of incidental thyroid papillary microcarcinoma patients treated with surgery for benign thyroid disease to validate absence of oncological follow-up and reduce unnecessary health expenses. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Method(s): We analyzed patient's files and interviewed 252 patients by telephone whose cases were submitted to the multidisciplinary meeting of thyroid pathology in Strasbourg, France, for incidental thyroid papillary microcarcinoma without clinical lymph node involvement, between January 1996 and December 2012. Result(s): Thirteen patients (5.8%) died while the data were being collected; however, none of the deaths were due to the thyroid pathology, and no patients showed signs of relapse of the thyroidectomy or cervical lymph node level. Conclusion(s): Our retrospective study shows that patients with incidental localized thyroid papillary microcarcinoma who underwent surgery without radioactive iodine treatment have an identical survival compared to the general population at the same age to validate absence of oncological follow-up and reduce unnecessary health expenses.

T1  - Use and overuse of diagnostic neck ultrasound in Ontario: Retrospective population-based cohort study
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the use and possible overuse of diagnostic neck ultrasound (DNUS) by describing and comparing both the ordering rates and the downstream results of DNUS by regions across Ontario. DESIGN: Retrospective population-based cohort study based on electronic health care data. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Ontario residents (adults aged > 18 years) who had a diagnosis of thyroid cancer between October 1, 1999, and June 30, 2014, and residents who had a DNUS in 2012. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of Ontario residents in each sub-Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) group who had their first DNUS in 2012 and went on to other relevant tests, diagnoses, and surgery. The sub-LHIN groups were based on increasing age- and sex-adjusted rates of first DNUS. RESULTS: There were 77 238 DNUS tests in 2012 and there was a 7.4-fold variation in the rate of test ordering across the sub-LHIN populations leading to variable rates of actual disease, suggesting screening or uncertain indications for tests. CONCLUSION: Across Ontario, the indications for ordering DNUS are variable, and screening or testing without indication might be a common practice. Establishing effective guidelines for the ordering of DNUS would potentially reduce costs and ultimately reduce the rates of thyroid cancer. Copyright© the College of Family Physicians of Canada.

T1  - The Relationship Between Imaging and Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis and Survival
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists over whether there has been a true increase in the occurrence of thyroid cancer or overdiagnosis secondary to imaging practices. Because cancer overdiagnosis is associated with detection of indolent disease, overdiagnosis can be associated with perceived improvement in survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database was used to determine the relationship between type of imaging leading to thyroid cancer diagnosis and survival. Disease-specific and overall survival were evaluated in 11,945 patients aged >=66 years with differentiated thyroid cancer diagnosed between January 1, 2001, and September 30, 2015, who prior to their cancer diagnosis initially underwent thyroid ultrasound versus other imaging capturing the neck. Analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model with propensity score. RESULTS: Patients who underwent thyroid ultrasound as compared with other imaging had improved disease-specific and overall survival (p < .001, p < .001). However, those who underwent thyroid ultrasound were less likely to have comorbidities (p < .001) and more likely to be younger (p < .001), be female (p < .001), have localized cancer (p < .001), and have tumor size <=1 cm (p < .001). After using propensity score analysis and adjusting for tumor characteristics, type of initial imaging still correlated with better overall survival but no longer correlated with better disease-specific survival. CONCLUSION: There is improved disease-specific survival in patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer after thyroid ultrasound as compared with after other imaging. However, better disease-specific survival is related to these patients being younger and healthier and having lower-risk cancer, suggesting that thyroid ultrasound screening contributes to cancer overdiagnosis. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings from this study have implications for patients, physicians, and policy makers. Patients who have thyroid ultrasound as their initial imaging are fundamentally different from those who are diagnosed after other imaging. Because patients undergoing ultrasound are younger and healthier and are diagnosed with lower-risk thyroid cancer, they are less likely to die of their thyroid cancer. However, being diagnosed with thyroid cancer can lead to cancer-related worry and create risks for harm from treatments. Thus, efforts are needed to reduce inappropriate use of ultrasound, abide by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, and apply nodule risk stratification tools when appropriate.

T1  - Ultrasound is superior to palpation for thyroid cancer detection in high-risk childhood cancer and BMT survivors
AB  - PURPOSE: Thyroid cancer is a common subsequent malignant neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors (CCS). Patients who received radiotherapy (RT) to the head, neck, upper thorax, or total body irradiation (TBI) are considered to be at risk for subsequent thyroid cancer. Current Children's Oncology Group screening guidelines recommend annual neck palpation. Our objective was to determine if ultrasound (US) is more sensitive and specific than palpation to detect thyroid cancer in high-risk CCS and bone marrow transplant (BMT) survivors. METHODS: Electronic medical records of patients followed in a longitudinal survivorship clinic from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2017 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included history of RT to the head, neck, upper thorax, or TBI for primary therapy or preparation for BMT prior to the age of 20 years. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-five patients had documented palpation and 144 (64%) also had US evaluation. Mean radiation dose was 28.6 Gy. Sixteen of 225 patients (7.1%) developed a subsequent thyroid cancer at a mean of 9.7 years from the completion of RT. Sensitivity of US was 100% compared with 12.5% for palpation. US demonstrated higher accuracy, with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 versus 0.56 for palpation (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Routine screening with US was more sensitive than palpation for detection of subsequent thyroid cancer after high-risk RT in CCS and BMT survivors. Screening US may lead to earlier detection of thyroid cancer in this population. Earlier diagnosis has the potential to decrease operative complexity, and earlier definitive therapy reduces the likelihood of metastatic disease.

T1  - Ultrasound versus physical exam to screen for secondary thyroid cancer among high-risk childhood cancer survivors
AB  - Background: Thyroid cancer is a common secondary malignancy among childhood cancer survivors who have received radiation to the head, neck and/or upper thorax. The optimal strategy for surveillance for thyroid carcinoma in childhood cancer survivors remains controversial. Current Children's Oncology Group recommendations are limited to physical exam. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of thyroid ultrasound versus neck exam by a pediatric endocrinologist in the diagnoses of thyroid cancer in a cohort of high-risk childhood cancer survivors. Method(s): Medical records of childhood cancer survivors who received radiotherapy to the head, neck and/or upper thorax were reviewed. These patients were seen in a comprehensive childhood cancer survivorship clinic from 01/01/2010 to 12/31/2017. Patient populations included oncology, bone marrow transplant and brain tumor patients. Result(s): 226 patients received radiation to the head, neck and/or upper thorax. Of those, 129 patients were male (57%). Sixteen (7.1%) of patients developed a secondary thyroid malignancy including 4 patients previously treated for an oncological malignancy, 9 patients treated with bone marrow transplantation, and 3 patients with a CNS malignancy. Median radiation dose was 1800 cGy (range 400-5940 cGy). Time to thyroid carcinoma diagnosis occurred at a median of 12 years (range 4-19 years) from treatment with radiation. Screening ultrasounds were obtained in 146 (65%) patients while 226 (100%) had a physical exam. Two cases were identified by abnormalities on physical exam. The sensitivity of US was 100% (CI 80.6-100) compared to a sensitivity of 12.5% (CI 3.5-36) using physical exam (P < 0.0001). Screening ultrasound had a specificity of 73% (CI 65.1-80.1) while physical exam yielded a specificity of 100% (CI 98.2-100). Conclusion(s): Regular screening with ultrasounds provide the greatest sensitivity for detection of secondary thyroid carcinomas after head, neck and upper thorax radiation in childhood cancer survivors. If screening ultrasounds were not routinely utilized in our clinic, 14 of the 16 patients (87.5%) would have had a delay in their diagnosis of a secondary thyroid malignancy. Screening ultrasounds may lead to earlier detection of thyroid carcinomas, with the potential to decrease the need for aggressive surgery, radioiodine therapy and, ultimately, to decrease recurrence risk.

T1  - Epidemiologic, Clinical, Ultrasonographic, and Cytological Features of Thyroid Nodules in Predicting Malignancy Risk: A Retrospective Study of 442 French Afro-Caribbean Patients
AB  - Objective. To evaluate epidemiologic, clinical, cytological, and ultrasonographic features of thyroid nodules in a sample French Afro-Caribbean population to determine if the standard criteria for predicting malignancy risk are applicable to this specific ethnic population. Methods and Design. This retrospectively designed study consisted of 442 patients who had consulted with the Endocrinology Department in Martinique (French overseas department) between 2007 and 2011. Of the 442 patients, 641 ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirations (US-FNA) were performed by two experienced endocrinologists, and 212 patients underwent surgery. The geographical situation, age, gender of the patient, clinical and ultrasonographic features, TSH level, and US-FNA results were considered and cross-referenced with their pathology results. Results. The overall malignancy rate on final histopathology was 9% (women only), 80% of which were papillary cancer, and 20% were follicular cancer. Occult micropapillary carcinoma represented 35% of the papillary cancer. There was no significant difference in age, nodule localization, number of nodules, or thyroid function test between benign and malignant nodules. Contrary to the literature, we found only 12% incidentaloma in our series, while more than half of the nodules were discovered on palpation or as a clinical symptom. Hypoechogenicity in solid pattern nodules and nodules between 2 and 3 cm in size revealed a high diagnostic value in detecting malignancy. The corresponding rate of malignancy on Bethesda system histopathologic examination was as follows: 0% in undiagnosed (I), 0% benign (II) (micropapillary), 5% (FLUS)/atypia (III), 9% follicular neoplasm (IV), 33% suspected malignancy (V), and no malignant cytology (VI). These results show a different Bethesda system predictive value for this French Afro-Caribbean population. Conclusion. Studies evaluating ethnic cancer disparities among patients with thyroid cancer are limited and do not specifically focus on the French Afro-Caribbean population. Despite rare thyroid incidentaloma, 35% of the papillary cancer cases were micropapillary carcinoma, and the incidence and standardized mortality rate in Martinique are lower than in metropolitan France. The malignant risk distribution of thyroid FNA Bethesda classification in this sample population differs from the standard risk, and it is necessary to take that into account in the decision to operate by associating it with echographic malignancy criteria.Copyright © 2020 Johan Joseph-Auguste et al.

T1  - Comparison of the prevalence of incidental and non-incidental papillary thyroid microcarcinoma during 2008-2016: a single-center experience
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasing; however, it is not clear whether this reflects an increase in the incidence of incidental or in that of non-incidentally (presurgically) discovered PTMC (IPTMC vs. NIPTMC). We assessed the incidence of IPTMC and NIPTMC over the past 9 years, to discern whether the increase in PTMC incidence is due to improved diagnostics or to a real increase in the incidence. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 4327 patients who were consecutively admitted to and surgically treated for thyroid pathology at a single institution. As a main presurgical diagnostic test, all patients underwent ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (UG-FNAB). The analyzed time frame was divided into three equal periods (I: 2008-2010, II: 2011-2013, III: 2014-2016), and IPTMCs and NIPTMCs were assessed and compared in each period. RESULTS: We evaluated 393 (9.08%) patients with thyroid malignancy, of which 156 (3.60% of all thyroid tumors [TTs]; 39.69% of all thyroid cancers [TCs]) were diagnosed as PTMC. The prevalence of NIPTMC among all TCs increased from 16.66% in 2008 to 33.75% in 2016, while that of IPTMC decreased from 20.83% in 2008 to 13.75% in 2016. The incidence rates of NIPTMC and IPTMC in period III differed statistically significantly (p < 0.0001). The prevalence rate of NIPTMC in period III was higher than that in period II, yet comparable to that in period I (p = 0.0014; p = 0.2804, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of NIPTMC, rather than that of IPTMC, is escalating; this may be due to better presurgical diagnosis.

T1  - Incidental versus clinically diagnosed differentiated thyroid cancer in both adult and elderly subjects: histological characteristics and follow-up in a retrospective analysis from a single institution
AB  - PURPOSE: Most thyroid cancer are incidentally diagnosed. However, little is known on the different modalities of incidental diagnosis in adult versus older patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 440 patients consecutively diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in a single institution. Modalities of diagnosis were categorized as follows: (A) clinically diagnosed, nonincidental cases; (B) incidental during carotid power-duplex (CPD); (C) incidental during neck imaging other than carotid power-duplex; (D) incidental during imaging workup of thyroid dysfunction or at histological examination after thyroidectomy for benign lesions. Demographics, histology and follow-up were compared between adult (<65 years) and older (>=65 years) patients according to the different modalities of diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 363 and 67 cases were recorded in adult and older patients, respectively with incidental proportions of 79% and 85%, respectively. A P < 0.001 significant difference in the modality of diagnosis was found between adult and older subjects, the latter presenting with a higher prevalence of Group B. In the nonincidental group, papillary histotype, larger size, and extrathyroidal invasion were more frequently observed in older subjects. Disease-free survival was comparable between adult and older subjects in the incidental cases, whereas it was reduced, though not significantly, in older subjects. CONCLUSION: Incidental cases of DTC are more frequently diagnosed in the old subjects and are mainly due to CPD. Disease-free survival is comparable between adult and older subjects in both incidental and nonincidental cases, although it may be slightly reduced in nonincidentally diagnosed older patients.

T1  - Thyroid cancer in Friuli Venezia Giulia, northeastern Italy: incidence, overdiagnosis, and impact of type of surgery on survival
AB  - BACKGROUND: Incidence rates of thyroid cancer (TC) increased in the last decades worldwide. This study aimed to describe TC incidence in the Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) region, to estimate the quota of overdiagnosis, and to investigate the impact of surgery on long-term survival after TC diagnosis. METHODS: TC cases reported to the FVG population-based cancer registry during 2002-2013, aged <85 years, were included. Age standardized rates (ASR) on the European population were computed, while proportion of TC overdiagnosis was estimated in comparison with expected age-specific incidence rates from published time series. Adjusted hazard ratios of death, with 95% confidence intervals, were also estimated. RESULTS: During 2002-2013, 1701 TC cases were reported to the FVG cancer registry, with papillary TC (78.2%) as the most frequent histologic type. ASR increased from 12.4 to 16.5 in women and from 4.3 to 6.2 in men (+33.1% and +44.2%, respectively). Overdiagnosis was estimated as 79% of TC cases in women and 64% in men. Almost all TC cases (97.1%) underwent surgery, including 84.6% of women and 78.9% of men who underwent total thyroidectomy. Up to 10 years after TC diagnosis, the type of surgery did not appear to influence survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study documented an increase in TC incidence in FVG in the last decade, with overdiagnosis accounting for a large proportion of TC diagnoses and total thyroidectomy in more than 80% of cases. These findings suggest reconsidering thyroid screening practice and aggressive therapeutic strategies, as recommended by new TC guidelines.

T1  - Incidental thyroid carcinoma in Benign thyroid disease: A cohort study
AB  - Aim: An incidental thyroid carcinoma (ITC) is a thyroid malignancy that is not clinically or cytologically detected preoperatively. The incidence of ITC is between 10% to 20% in the literature. A study was undertaken to assess the incidence of ITC in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy or benign disease of the thyroid to University Surgical Unit, North Colombo Teaching Hospital (NCTH), Sri Lanka. Material(s) and Method(s): Prospective cohort study was undertaken rom November, 2002 to October, 2015. Patients with palpable thyroid nodules were assessed with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and ultrasound scan (USS) to ascertain benign thyroid disease (BTD). Hormone assays were conducted to detect thyroid status. All patients with BTD who underwent total thyroidectomy were included in the study. Histopathological assessments were made by a panel of pathologists. Patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) were excluded due to the known association with malignancy of the thyroid. Post-thyroidectomy histopathological diagnoses were collected prospectively and patients with ITC were identified. Statistical analysis was done using statistical package or the social sciences (SPSS) sotware, version 20. Result(s): Hundred and sixty seven patients (n = 167) who ul-filled the inclusion criteria were analysed (Male-20, emale-147, median age = 40.25 year, range 28 year-62 year). ITC was ound in 19 patients with an incidence of 11.38%. No significant association was noted with morphology, biochemical status of the thyroid or gender. Conclusion(s): Incidence of ITC is 11.38% in this cohort. Incidence of ITC being approximately 1:10 emphasizes the need to consider total thyroidectomy in the management of BTD.Copyright © 2018, Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd.

T1  - Rising thyroid cancer incidence in Kerala: Is it real or over diagnosis?
AB  - Background: There has been an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in India and in high income countries. One of the reasons for this has been attributed to the large number of screening programs. Kerala state ranks second highest in the incidence of thyroid cancer in India. Screening provides the advantage of early detection of cancer and successful treatment but also tends to over diagnose. Method(s): To study the trend of incidence of primary thyroid cancer among newly diagnosed cancer patients and its association with the mode of detection, we retrospectively reviewed hospital based cancer registry data of patients with thyroid cancer who were treated at AIMS (Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences), Kochi between 2004-2014. All patients who were newly diagnosed with primary thyroid cancer at our center or referred to us after initial surgery were included in this analysis. Patients with recurrent cancer/metastases were excluded. Result(s): We analyzed the records of 2,315 newly diagnosed thyroid cancer patients. Median age was 44.1yrs (range 13-90yrs). There were 619 males and 1696 females. Papillary type was the most common 85.8% followed by follicular type 7.4%. 1235 cases were operated at AIMS. 74 cases (3.2%) were diagnosed incidentally by Ultrasonography/PET scan/CT scan. All others (97% n = 2,245) presented with neck swelling. It was seen that the proportion of new cases of thyroid cancer among all new cancer cases was increasing serially from 4.6 % (n = 106, 95% 2004) to 7.4% (n = 195) to13.7% (n = 317, 2014). There was a significant increase in the number of cases of T1 a and T1 b at the time of diagnosis during the study period (n = 1235, p value < 0.001 and p value for trend < 0.001 respectively) which indicates that there was early diagnosis. 97% of the cases presented with thyroid related symptoms indicating that clinical presentation has still been the main mode of detection in our series. Conclusion(s): Our data shows that there may be a true increase in the number of cases of thyroid cancer as majority presented with clinical symptoms, except few detected incidentally. As it is a single institution based data we need further studies to see if over use of USG based imaging for any thyroid swelling is responsible for an apparent increase in the number of thyroid cancer cases.

T1  - Incidental and Non-incidental Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma in Denmark 1996-2015: A national study on incidence, outcome and thoughts on active surveillance
AB  - Background: Incidental and non-incidental papillary microcarcinomas (PMC) are associated with different outcomes and treatment options may vary. The least favourable outcome is typically seen when carcinoma is suspected prior to surgery. Only a few studies have addressed the prognosis based on the way of detection for PMC, and they have been limited to retrospective single-center studies. We hypothesize that the "way of detection" may predict prognosis. The aim was to calculate the incidence and outcome of PMC based on the way of detection and to identify patients that may be suitable for active surveillance. Method(s): This national cohort study consists of 803 patients diagnosed with PMC in Denmark from 1996 to 2015. Patients were identified from the DATHYRCA database and allocated into groups according to the way of detection leading to surgery: Incidental at surgery (n = 527), non-incidental with symptoms suspected from the index tumor (n = 134) and non-incidental with symptoms suspected from a metastasis (n = 142). Result(s): Age-standardized incidence rates increased from 0.35 per 100,000 per year in 1996 to 1.19 per 100,000 per year in 2015. A significant rise in incidence was found for both the incidental group and non-incidental group with symptoms suspected from a metastasis. Recurrence free survival was significantly worse for patients with suspicion of metastasis prior to surgery than patient groups without. No difference in mortality was found between groups. Conclusion(s): PMC patients without suspicion of metastasis have the same low risk of recurrence as incidental cases and may be candidates for active surveillance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

T1  - Method of detection of thyroid nodules: correlation with frequency of fine-needle aspiration and malignancy rate
AB  - Background: Thyroid nodules are commonly found by screening, and the clinical implications are unclear. Method(s): We retrospectively studied 460 patients who were evaluated for thyroid nodules. Medical records were queried to determine how the nodules were detected. We compared the rates of fine needle aspiration (FNA) and malignancy between nodules detected clinically, incidentally on imaging, or by screening. Result(s): Nodules were detected clinically in 184 patients (40%), incidentally in 121 patients (26%), and by screening in 155 patients (34%). The rates of FNA and malignancy were lower for patients with nodules detected by screening (28% and 1%, respectively), compared to patients with clinically apparent nodules (75% and 15%) and patients with incidental nodules (69% and 8% [P <.001]). Conclusion(s): Thyroid nodules detected via screening has a lower rate of FNA and is less likely to be diagnosed as a malignancy compared to nodules detected clinically or incidentally on imaging. Thyroid ultrasound examinations should be reserved for nodules that are clinically apparent or to evaluate nodules found incidentally on imaging.Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Incidental versus clinical diagnosis of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. Long-term prognosis
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The incidence of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) has increased in recent years, especially in patients operated on for presumably benign thyroid disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the differences between PTMC incidentally diagnosed and PTMC clinically diagnosed, as well as its long-term prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of patients with a histological diagnosis of PTMC. Patients with previous thyroid surgery, other synchronous thyroid or extrathyroid malignancies and an ectopic location of PTMC were excluded. Two groups were compared: patients with PTMC incidentally diagnosed (group 1) and patients with PTMC clinically diagnosed (group 2). A multivariate analysis of differentiating factors was performed. RESULTS: PTMC clinically diagnosed had a high frequency of hypothyroidism (4.6% vs. 18.9%; P=.004), extrathyroidal extension (5.7% vs. 17.6%; P=.018), metastatic lymph nodes (1.1% vs. 18.9%; P<.001) and lymphocytic thyroiditis (5.7% vs. 27%; P<.001). In the multivariate analysis, metastatic lymph nodes (OR: 22.011, IC 95%: 2.621-184.829; P=.004) and lymphocytic thyroiditis (OR: 4.949; IC 95%: 1.602-15.288; P=.005) were associated with the clinical diagnosis of PTMC. During a mean follow-up of 119.8+/-65.1 months, one recurrence was detected in group 2 (0% vs. 1,4%; P=.460). No patient died due to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: PTMC clinically diagnosed, although it has more aggressive histopathological characteristics (extrathyroidal extension and metastatic lymph nodes), presents a long-term prognosis similar to the PTMC incidentally diagnosed. The presence of metastatic lymph nodes and lymphocytic thyroiditis were independent factors associated with PTMC clinically diagnosed. Copyright © 2019 SEEN y SED.

T1  - Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma: Finding meaning to active surveillance
AB  - Papillary Thyroid Cancer (PTC) measuring 1 cm is known as Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma (PTMC). This definition does not depend on the presence or absence of high risk features such as lymph node metastasis and/or distant metastasis. Although apparently small thyroid carcinomas frequently are present in otherwise healthy adult people, most of them are considered harmless to their hosts. Active surveillance (AS) of low risk PTMC was adopted by the American Thyroid Association guidelines since 2015. However, in our center all diagnosed PTMC underwent surgery. Observational, crosssectional, retrospective study of 867 patients that underwent total thyroidectomy between 2012 and 2017, in CEDIMAT, Dominican Republic. From those, 205 (23.4%) were diagnosed as Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC), of which 82 (40%) were confirmed as PTMC. For studying purposes this group was subclassified in 5mm and <5 mms. From the 82 PTMC, 68 (83%) presented 5mm and 14 (17%) < 5 mms. Metastasis was reported in 5 patients (6.09%) with >5mm. PTMC diagnosis was incidental in 4 patients operated from Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), 3 of them (80%) presenting adenomas and 1 (20%) parathyroid carcinoma. Almost half of our DTC cases were PTMC of which only 6% were of high risk. Active surveillance of PTMC is not a common practice in Dominican Republic, sociocultural factors may be related to this behavior. Would active surveillance in our context translate into delayed surgical intervention? Are there genetic factors that increase the incidence of PTMC?

T1  - Clinicopathological features of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma with a diameter less than or equal to 5mm
AB  - Purpose: This retrospective study was conducted to assess the epidemiological, clinical and histologic characteristics of incidentally identified and presurgically diagnosed papillary thyroid microcarcinomas less than or equal to 5 mm in size (small PTMC). Material(s) and Method(s): Cases from October 2003 to February 2018 were retrieved from pathology databases, and their clinicopathological features were reviewed. Result(s): There were a total of 182 cases of small PTMCs, 141 women and 41 men. The mean age at diagnosis was 53.5. Most of the small PTMCs were not detected on clinical examination and workup and were diagnosed incidentally during pathologic examination. 21.4% of small PTMCs showed multifocality, with 21 cases of unilateral multifocal lesions and 18 cases with bilateral multifocal tumors. Small PTMCs were most often follicular variant (51.9%) followed by classic type (47.5%). The average size of follicular variants appeared to be larger than that of the classic type PTMCs (2.84 +/- 1.43 mm vs 2.26 +/- 1.51 mm, P = 0.01). A total of 66 cases (36.3%) had regional lymph node sampling or selective neck dissection and 15 of these cases identified lymph node metastasis (22.7%). 46.7% of patients with node positive microcarcinomas were male compared with 16% male in group with negative lymph nodes (P = 0.03). Conclusion(s): Small PTMCs (<=5 mm) are often multifocal and bilateral and histology is commonly both the classical and follicular variant of PTC. While often diagnosed incidentally small PTMC can lead to regional lymph node involvement in a significant portion of cases and evaluation of the regional lymph nodes should be considered in the clinical management of these patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Micropapillary carcinomas: Description and evolution of standardized incidence from French Marne-Ardennes thyroid cancers register
AB  - Yearly incidence of thyroid cancer has nearly tripled in the past four decades, due to improvement and better use of diagnostic proceedings, which allows to detect tumors of smaller size, such as papillary microcarcinoma (MPC), defined as equal or less than 10 mm. The aim of our study was to validate the increasing incidence rate, to describe the characteristics and the circumstances of discovery of MPC, based on the Marne-Ardennes thyroid cancer register, from 1975 to 2014. Our observational, descriptive, historical cohort study is based on data from the specialized thyroid cancer register, which includes all subjects living in the Marne or Ardennes French departments, who were diagnosed with thyroid cancer between 1975 and 2014. 2671 patients with thyroid cancer between 1975 and 2014 were included, whose 966 (36.2%) were MPC. This percentage increases from 18.9% to 45.1% between the 1975-1984 period and the 2005-2014 period. Standardized incidence rates per 100,000 PY increased from 0.86 to 6.20 between the 1975-1984 period and the 2005-2014 period. Incidence was higher in women (1.15 in 1975-1984; 8.91 in 2005-2014) then in men (0.20 in 1975-1984; 2.54 in 2005-2014). Incidence rates increased more in 50 year-old people (from 0.41 in 1975-1984; to 4.21 in 2005-2014) then in <50 (0.45 in 1975-1984; to 1.99 in 2005-2014). Most of MPC (80.4%) were incidentally discovered on histological examination. They were mainly unifocal (79.4%). There tumors were associated with excellent morbidity and survival rate: there were few evolutive events (1.9%); no patient died fromMPC (91 deaths due to other cause). Our retrospective study demonstrates a large rise in the incidence of MPC. Most of MPC were incidentally discovered on histological examination in the context of surgery for benign pathology. Changes in access to health care, and physician's and pathologists' practices are likely explanations of our results.

T1  - Low-Risk Thyroid Cancer in Elderly: Total Thyroidectomy/RAI Predominates but Lacks Survival Advantage
AB  - Background: Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the fastest increasing cancer in the United States; incidence increases with age. It generally has a favorable prognosis but may behave more aggressively in older patients. This study aims to describe national treatment patterns for low-risk PTC in older adults. Material(s) and Method(s): The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database was used to identify patients >=66 y treated for clinical T1N0M0 PTC between 1996 and 2011. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with extent of surgery (total thyroidectomy versus lobectomy) and radioactive iodine (RAI) administration. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate the effect of treatment type on disease-specific survival (DSS). Result(s): Three thousand two hundred and fourteen patients met inclusion criteria; 77.6% were women, median age was 72 y, and mean tumor size was 0.7 cm. 42.7% had preoperatively diagnosed PTC (versus incidental). 65.4% underwent total thyroidectomy, 29.0% lobectomy, and 5.6% lobectomy followed by completion thyroidectomy; 33.4% received postoperative RAI. Five- and 10-year DSS were 98.9% and 98.3%, respectively. After adjustment, larger tumor size (1.1-2 cm), multifocality, and a preoperative PTC diagnosis were associated with greater odds of undergoing more extensive surgery and receiving RAI (P < 0.0001). DSS was not associated with extent of surgery or RAI administration (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Most older adults with PTC underwent total thyroidectomy and a third received RAI; neither treatment improved DSS. In the growing elderly population, less extensive interventions for PTC may reduce morbidity and improve quality of life while preserving an excellent prognosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
